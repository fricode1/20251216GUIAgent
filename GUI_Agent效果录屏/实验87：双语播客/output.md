# **Chapter i: Ideas in general, and their origin**



**1.** Everyone is conscious to himself that he thinks; and
when thinking is going on, the mind is engaged with _ideas_
that it contains.
So it’s past doubt that men have in their
minds various ideas, such as are those expressed by the
words ‘whiteness’, ‘hardness’, ‘sweetness’, ‘thinking’, ‘motion’, ‘man’, ‘elephant’, ‘army’, ‘drunkenness’, and others.
The first question, then, is _How does he acquire these ideas?_
It is widely believed that men have ideas stamped upon
their minds in their very first being.
My opposition to
this in Book I will probably be received more favourably
when I have shown where the understanding _can_ get all its
ideas from—an account that I contend will be supported by
everyone’s own observation and experience.


**2.** Let us then suppose the mind to have no ideas in it, to
be like _white paper_ with nothing written on it.
How then
does it come to be written on?
From where does it get
that vast store which the busy and boundless imagination
of man has painted on it—all the materials of reason and
knowledge?
To this I answer, in one word, from _experience_ .
Our understandings derive all the materials of thinking
from _observations_ that we make of •external objects that
can be perceived through the senses, and of •the internal
operations of our minds, which we perceive by looking in at
ourselves.These two are the fountains of knowledge, from
which arise all the ideas we have or can naturally have.


**3.** First, our senses when applied to particular perceptible
objects convey into the mind many distinct perceptions of
things, according to the different ways in which the objects
affect them.
That’s how we come by the ideas we have of
yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all



so on—the so-called ‘sensible qualities’.
When I say the
senses convey ·these ideas· into the mind, ·I don’t mean
this strictly and literally, because I don’t mean to say that
an idea actually _travels across_ from the perceived object
to the person’s mind.
Rather· I mean that through the
senses external objects convey into the mind _something that_
_produces there_ those perceptions [= ‘ideas’].
This great source
of most of the ideas we have I call SENSATION.


**4.** Secondly, the other fountain from which experience
provides ideas to the understanding is the perception of
the operations of our own mind within us.
This yields
ideas that couldn’t be had from external things—ones such
as ·the ideas of· perception, thinking, doubting, believing,
reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different things that
our minds do.
Being conscious of these actions of the mind
and observing them in ourselves, our understandings get
from them ideas that are as distinct as the ones we get from
bodies affecting our senses.
Every man has this source
of ideas wholly within himself; and though it is not _sense_,
because it has nothing to do with external objects, it is
still very like sense, and might properly enough be called
‘internal sense’.
But along with calling the other ‘sensation’,
I call this REFLECTION, because the ideas it gives us can
be had only by a mind reflecting on its own operations
within itself.
By ‘reflection’ then, in the rest of this work,
I mean the notice that the mind takes of _what_ it is doing,
and _how_ . (I am here using ‘operations’ in a broad sense,
to cover not only the _actions_ of the mind on its ideas but
also _passive states_ that can arise from them, such as is the
satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.) So
that’s my thesis: all our ideas take their beginnings from


those two sources—external material things as objects of
sensation, and the operations of our own minds as objects
of reflection.


**5.** . . . .
When we have taken a full survey of •the ideas
we get from these sources, and of their various modes,
combinations, and relations, we shall find they are •our
whole stock of ideas; and that we have nothing in our minds
that didn’t come in one of these two ways. [Locke then
challenges the reader to ‘search into his understanding’ and
see whether he has any ideas other than those of sensation
and reflection.]


**6.** If you look carefully at the state of a new-born child, you’ll
find little reason to think that he is well stocked with ideas
that are to be the matter of his future knowledge.
He gets
ideas gradually; and though the ideas of obvious and familiar
qualities imprint themselves before the memory begins to
keep a record of when or how, ideas of unusual qualities are
different.
Some of _them_ come so late that most people can
remember when they first had them.
And if we had reason
to, we _could_ arrange for child to be brought up in such a
way as to have very few ideas, even ordinary ones, until
he had grown to manhood.
In actuality children are born
into the world surrounded by bodies that perpetually affect
them so as to imprint on their minds a variety of ideas: light
and colours are busy everywhere, as long as the eyes are
open; sounds and some tangible qualities engage the senses
appropriate to them, and force an entrance into the mind.
But I think you’ll agree that if a child were kept in a place
where he never saw any colour but black and white till he
was a man, he would have no ideas of scarlet or green—any
more than a person has an idea of the taste of oysters or of
pineapples if he has never actually tasted either.


**7.** How many simple ideas a person has depends ·for ideas



of sensation· on what variety there is among the external
objects that he perceives, and ·for ideas of reflection· on
how much he reflects on the workings of his own mind.
·The focussed intensity of the reflection is relevant, because·:
someone who contemplates the operations of his mind can’t
help having plain and clear ideas of them; he won’t have
clear and distinct ideas of all the operations of his mind
and everything that happens in them _unless he turns his_
_thoughts that way and considers them attentively_ ; any more
than he can have ideas of all the details of a landscape
painting, or of the parts and motions of a clock, if he doesn’t
look at it and focus his attention on all the parts of it.
The
picture or clock may be so placed that he encounters them
every day, but he’ll have only a confused idea of all the parts
they are made up of, until he applies himself with attention
to consider each part separately.


**8.** That’s why most children don’t get ideas of the operations
of their own minds until quite late, and why some people
_never_ acquire any very clear or perfect ideas of most of their
mental operations.
Their mental operations are there all the
time, like floating visions; but until the understanding turns
inward upon itself, reflects on them, and makes them the
objects of its own thoughts, they won’t make deep enough
impressions to leave in the person’s mind clear, distinct,
lasting ideas.
Children enter the world surrounded by
new things that constantly attract their senses, beckoning
to a mind that is eager to notice new things and apt to
be delighted with the variety of changing objects.
So the
first years are usually spent in looking outwards ·at the
surroundings·; and so people grow up constantly attending
to outward sensation, reflecting very little on what happens
within them till they come to be of riper years—and some not
even then.


**9.** When does a man first have any ideas?
That is the same
as asking: when does a man begin to perceive?
For having
ideas and perception are the same thing.
I know that some
philosophers hold that the soul [= ‘mind’; no religious implications]
_always_ thinks, and that it has the actual perception of ideas
in itself constantly as long as it exists.
For them, •actual
thinking is as inseparable from •the soul as •actual extension
is from •the body, which implies that the question ‘When do
his ideas begin?’ is equivalent to ‘When does his soul begin?’.
For on their view the soul and its ideas must begin to exist
both at the same time. as do body and its extension [= ‘its

taking up space’].


**10.** How does •the soul’s beginning to exist relate to •the first
rudiments of organization—or to the beginnings of life—in
the body?
Before it, or at the same time, or later?
I leave
that question to be disputed by those who have thought
harder about it than I have. ·But I _do_ have a view about
how •the soul’s beginning to exist relates to •its first having
ideas, or at least to the view that the two must occur together
because a soul can’t exist except when it has ideas·.
I confess
that I have one of those dull souls that doesn’t perceive
itself always to contemplate ideas; and I don’t think it’s
any more necessary for the soul always to think than for
the body always to move.
In my view, _the perception of_
_ideas_ is to _the soul_ as _motion_ is to _the body_ —not something
that •is essential to it, but something that •it sometimes
does.
So even if thinking is an activity that is uniquely
appropriate to the soul, that doesn’t require us to suppose
that the soul is always thinking, always in action.
Perhaps
that is a gift possessed by God, ‘who never slumbers nor
sleeps’ [Psalm 121:3], but it isn’t appropriate for any finite
being, or at least not to the soul of man.
We know by
experience that we sometimes think; and from this we validly



infer that there is in us something—·some substance·—that
is able to think; but whether that substance perpetually
thinks or not is a question we must answer on the basis
of what experience informs us.
To say that ·experience is
irrelevant because· actual thinking is _essential_ to the soul
and ·thus conceptually· inseparable from it, is to assume
the very thing that is in question.
Such a claim needs to be
supported by arguments, unless the claim is a self-evident
proposition—and I don’t think anyone will contend that _The_
_soul always thinks_ is self-evident. [The section continues
with mockery of people who purport to prove something by
assuming it among the premises of their argument; and with
a reply to a critic who, misunderstanding something in the
first edition of the _Essay_, had accused Locke of thinking that
when you are asleep your soul doesn’t exist.]


**11.** I grant that the soul in a waking man is never without
thought, because that’s what it _is_ to be awake.
But I
suspect that in sleeping without dreaming, the whole man is
asleep—his mind as well as his body—so that in that state
no thought is occurring.
If the soul thinks in a sleeping man
without being conscious of it, I ask whether during such
thinking •the soul has any pleasure or pain, or any ability
to be happy or miserable?
I am sure •the man does not, any
more than •the bed he lies on has pleasure or pain.
For to be
happy or miserable without being conscious of it seems to me
utterly inconsistent and impossible.
If you say that •the soul
might be in any of those states while the body is sleeping,
and •the unsleeping man have no consciousness of them, I
reply: In that case Socrates asleep and Socrates awake are
not the same person, but two persons. [Locke elaborates this
in the remainder of section **11** and on through **12**, relying
on a view of his about personal identity that he’ll develop
more clearly and at greater length in xxvii.]


**13.** Thus, I think, every drowsy nod shakes the doctrine of
those who teach that the soul is always thinking!
Anyway,
those who do at some time sleep without dreaming can never
be convinced that their thoughts are for four hours busy
without their knowing of it; and if they are taken in the very
act, waked in the middle of those sleeping thoughts, they
can give no account of it.


**14.** It will perhaps be said that the soul thinks even in the
soundest sleep but the memory doesn’t retain those thoughts.
·This is utterly implausible·. . . .
Who can imagine that most
men, for several hours every day of their lives, think of
something of which they could remember nothing at all, even
if they were asked in the middle of these thoughts?
Most men,
I think, pass a great part of their sleep without dreaming.
I
knew a man who was bred a scholar, and had a pretty good
memory, who told me that he had never dreamed in his life
till he had a fever at the age of twenty-five.
Everyone will
have acquaintances who pass most of their nights without
dreaming.


**15.** To think often, and never to retain it so much as one
moment, is a very useless sort of thinking.
The soul in such
a state of thinking would be little better than a looking-glass
which constantly receives a variety of images but retains
none of them; they disappear and vanish without leaving a
trace; the looking-glass is never the better for such images,
nor the soul for such thoughts. ·We might also ask _why_
it should be that all sleeping thoughts are forgotten, given
that many waking ones are remembered.
Here is a possible
answer to that·:

In a waking man the materials of the body are used
in thinking, and the memory of thoughts is retained
by the impressions that are made on the brain and
the traces left there after such thinking; but in the



thinking of the soul that isn’t perceived in a sleeping
man, the soul thinks apart, making no use of the
organs of the body and so leaving no impressions
on the body and consequently no memory of such
thoughts.


. . . .I answer that whatever ideas the mind can _receive and_
_contemplate_ without the help of the body it can also—it is
reasonable to think— _retain_ without the help of the body
too.
If not, then the soul gets little advantage by thinking.
If •it has no memory of its own thoughts; if •it can’t lay
them up for its own use, and be able to recall them at
need; if •it can’t reflect on what is past, and make use of
its former experiences, reasonings, and contemplations—
then •what does it think _for_ ?
Those who make the soul
a thinking thing in _this_ way don’t make it much nobler
than do those (whom they condemn) who claim it to be
nothing but very finely ground matter.
Words written on
dust that the first breath of wind wipes out, or impressions
made on a heap of atoms or bodily fluids, are every bit as
useful and ennobling as the thoughts of a soul that perish in
thinking—thoughts that once out of sight are gone for ever
and leave no memory of themselves behind them.
Nature
never makes excellent things for trivial uses or for no use;
and it’s hardly to be conceived that our infinitely wise creator
should bring it about that something as admirable as the
power of thinking—the power ·of ours· that comes nearest
to the excellence of his own incomprehensible being—is so
idly and uselessly employed, at least a quarter of the time,
that it thinks constantly without remembering any of those
thoughts, without doing any good to itself or others or being
any way useful to any other part of the creation.
If you think
about it, I doubt if you’ll find that the motion of dull and
senseless _matter_ is ever, anywhere in the universe, made so
little use of and so wholly thrown away.


[In section **16** Locke writes of thoughts that we do sometimes
have in our sleep and remember after waking, pointing out
that they are mostly ‘extravagant and incoherent’.
He says
that his present opponents, faced with this evidence, will
have to say that the soul thinks better when employing the
body that when thinking ‘apart’ from the body.
He evidently
thinks that this is an intolerable conclusion.]


[In sections **17–22** Locke continues to urge the empirical
implausibility of the thesis that the soul always thinks, and
the unreasonable dogmatism of those who insist on it as
necessarily true whatever experience may say.
Much of the
content of these sections repeats things said earlier in the
chapter.
The discussion gradually moves over to Locke’s
thesis that the soul thinks only when it has ideas to think
with, and to his view about how ideas are acquired.
And so
the chapter circles back to where it was in section 9.]


**23.** When does a man begin to have any ideas?
I think the
true answer is: when he first has some sensation.
Since
there appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the
senses have conveyed any in, I think that ideas in the understanding arise at the same time as sensation.
Sensation
is •an impression or motion made in some part of the body
that produces •some perception in the understanding.
It is
about these impressions made on our senses by outward
objects that the mind seems first to employ itself in such operations as we call perception, remembering, consideration,



reasoning, etc.


**24.** In time the mind comes to reflect on _its own dealing_
_with_ the ideas acquired from _sensation_, and thereby stores
up a new set of ideas that I call ideas of _reflection_ . . . .
The
first capacity of human intellect is that the mind is fitted
to receive the impressions made on it, either through the
senses by outward objects, or by its own operations when it
reflects on them.
This is the first step a man makes towards
the discovery of anything, and the basis on which to build
all the notions he will ever have naturally in this world.
All
those sublime thoughts that tower above the clouds and
reach as high as heaven itself take off from here. . . .


**25.** In the getting of ideas the understanding is merely
passive.
It has no control over whether it will have these
beginnings—these materials, so to speak—of knowledge.
For
many of the objects of our senses shove their particular
ideas into our minds, whether we want them or not; and the
operations of our minds won’t let us be without at least _some_
obscure notions of them.
No man can be wholly ignorant of
what he does when he thinks.
The understanding can no
more refuse to have these simple ideas when they are offered
to it, or alter them once they have been imprinted, or blot
them out and make new ones itself, than a mirror can refuse,
alter, or obliterate the images or ideas that the objects placed
in front of it produce on its surface. . . .


# **Chapter ii: Simple ideas**



**1.** To get a better grasp of what our knowledge is, how
it comes about, and how far it reaches, we must carefully
attend to one fact about our ideas, namely that some of them
are _simple,_ and some _complex_ .
The _qualities_ that affect our senses are intimately united
and blended in the things themselves, but it is obvious that
the _ideas_ they produce in the mind enter (via the senses)
simple and unmixed.
A single sense will often take in
different ideas from one object at one time—as when a man
_sees_ motion and colour together, or the hand _feels_ softness
and warmth in a single piece of wax—and yet the simple
ideas that are thus brought together in a single mind are as
perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses.
The •coldness and hardness a man feels in a piece of ice are
as distinct ideas in the mind as the •smell and whiteness of a
lily, or as the •taste of sugar and smell of a rose.
And nothing
can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct perception
he has of those simple ideas, each of which contains nothing
but one uniform appearance or conception in the mind, and
is not distinguishable into different ideas.


**2.** These simple ideas, which are the materials of all our
knowledge, are suggested and supplied to the mind only by
sensation and reflection.
Once the understanding has been
stocked with these simple ideas, it is able to repeat, compare,
and unite them, to an almost infinite variety, and so can
make new complex ideas as it will.
But no-one, however
quick and clever, can invent one new simple idea that wasn’t
taken in by one of those two ways.
Nor can any force of the
understanding destroy those that are there.
Man’s power



over this little world of his own understanding is much like
his power over the great world of visible things, where he
can only compound and divide the materials that he finds
available to him, and can’t do anything towards making the
least particle of new matter, or destroying one atom of what
already exists. . . .


**3.** God could have made a creature with organs different
from ours, and more ways than our five senses to give
the understanding input from bodily things.
But I don’t
think any of us could imagine any qualities through which
bodies could come to our attention other than sounds, tastes,
smells, and visible and tangible qualities.
Had mankind been
made with only four senses, the qualities that are now the
objects of the fifth sense would have been as far from our
notice, imagination, and conception as now any belonging to
a sixth, seventh, or eighth sense can possibly be. (Actually,
I think that perhaps we do have six senses; but I have
been following the usual count, which is five; it makes no
difference to my present line of thought.) Are there creatures
in some other parts of this vast and stupendous universe
who have more senses than we do?
Perhaps.
If you consider
the immensity of this structure, and the great variety that
is to be found in our little part of it, you may be inclined to
think that there are somewhere different intelligent beings
whose capacities are as unknown to you as are the senses
or understanding of a man to a worm shut up in one drawer
of a desk.
Such variety and excellence would be suitable to
the wisdom and power of our maker.


# **Chapter iii: Ideas of one sense**



**1.** We shall get a better grasp of the ideas we receive from
sensation if we classify them according to their different ways
of getting into our minds.

First, some come into our minds by one sense only.
Secondly, others enter the mind by more senses than
one.
Thirdly, yet others are had from reflection only.
Fourthly, some are suggested to the mind by all the
ways of sensation and reflection.
We shall consider them separately, under these headings.
First, some ideas are admitted through only one sense,
which is specially adapted to receive them.
Thus •light and
colours come in only by the eyes, all kinds of •noises, sounds,
and tones only by the ears; the various •tastes and •smells
by the nose and palate.
If these organs, or the nerves that
are the channels along which they communicate with the
brain, become disordered so that they don’t perform their
functions, the associated ideas have no door through which
to enter, no other way to bring themselves into view and be
perceived by the understanding.



The main ones belonging to touch are •heat and cold,
and •solidity.
Most of the others have to do with perceptible
•texture, like smooth and rough, or with more or less firm
•hanging together of the parts, like hard and soft, tough and
brittle.


**2.** I needn’t enumerate all the simple ideas belonging to each
sense.
Indeed, I can’t do so because there are many more
of them than we have names for.
Kinds of smell are at least
as numerous as kinds of bodies in the world, and few of
them have names.
We use ‘sweet’ and ‘stinking’ for them,
but this amounts to little more than calling them pleasing
or displeasing; the smell of a rose differs greatly from that
of a violet, though both are sweet. [Similarly—Locke goes
on to say—with tastes, and with colours and sounds.] In
my account of simple ideas, therefore, I shall pick out only
a few—mainly ones that are most important for my over-all
enquiry.
I shall also discuss some that tend to be overlooked,
though they are very frequently ingredients in our complex
ideas.
I think this is the case with _solidity_, which is my next
topic.


# **Chapter iv: Solidity**



**1.** We receive the idea of solidity by the sense of touch.
It
arises from our experience of a body’s resisting the entrance
of any other body into the place it occupies.
There is no



idea that we receive more constantly from sensation than
solidity.
Whether moving or at rest, we always feel something
under us that supports us and stops us from sinking further


downwards; and we have daily experience of how, when
holding a body between our two hands, the body absolutely
prevents the hands from touching one another.
My name
for the property whereby one body blocks two others from
touching is _solidity_ . (Mathematicians use that term in a
different sense, but mine is close enough to ordinary usage
to be acceptable.
If you prefer to call the property _impen-_
_etrability_, go ahead; but I prefer _solidity_ for two reasons.
•It is close to common speech. •The term ‘impenetrability’
seems to refer not to the property itself but to a consequence
of it, and a negative one at that; whereas ‘solidity’ means
something positive and points to the property itself, not a
mere consequence of it.) _Solidity_ seems to be the idea that is
most intimately connected with and essential to _body_ .
The
senses notice it only in masses of matter that are big enough
to cause a sensation in us; but once the mind has acquired
this idea from such large bodies, it traces the idea further
and considers it (as well as shape) in the minutest particle of
matter that can exist. ·Not only can we not imagine matter
without solidity, but· we cannot imagine solidity to exist
anywhere except in matter.


**2.** Solidity is the idea [here = ‘quality’] of body whereby we
conceive body to _fill space_ .
The idea of filling of space is this:
we imagine a space taken up by a solid substance which
we conceive it to _possess_ in such a way that all other solid
substances are excluded from it. . . .


**3.** This resistance whereby a body keeps other bodies out
of its space is so great that no force, however great, can
overcome it.
All the bodies in the world, pressing a drop of
water on all sides, can never overcome its resistance until it is
moved out of their way.
This distinguishes our idea of solidity
both from (a) pure space, which is not capable of resistance
or motion, and from (b) the ordinary idea of hardness. ·I shall



deal with (a) now, and with (b) in the next section.
My target
in (a) is Descartes, who held that whatever is extended is material, so that vacuum—understood as something extended
and immaterial—is conceptually impossible.
I shall discuss
this at length in xiii, merely sketching my case against it
here·.
We can conceive two bodies at a distance as being
able to meet and touch one another, without touching or
displacing any other solid thing.
This, I think, gives us a
clear idea of space without solidity.
Can we not have the idea
of one single body moving without any other immediately
taking its place?
Clearly we can, for •the idea of motion in
one body doesn’t include •the idea of motion in another—any
more than •the idea of squareness in one body includes •the
idea of squareness in another!
I’m not asking whether in
the actual state of the world it is _physically possible_ for one
body to move while no others do; answering this either way
would be taking a side on the debate over whether there is a
vacuum.
All I am asking is whether we can have _the idea of_
one body moving while no others do; and I think everyone
will answer that we can.
If so, then the place the body leaves
gives us the _idea of_ pure space without solidity, into which
any other body can enter without being resisted and without
displacing anything.
If it is the case that _when the piston in_
_a pump is pulled up, other matter has to take its place_, that
comes from the world’s being full, not from the mere _ideas_ of
space and solidity. . . .
The very fact that people argue about
whether there actually is a vacuum shows that they have
ideas of space without a body.


**4.** In contrast to solidity,. . . .
_hardness_ consists in a firm
cohesion of the parts of a mass of matter that is large enough
to be perceptible, so that the whole thing doesn’t easily
change its shape.
Indeed, we call things ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ only
in relation to the constitutions of our own bodies: we usually


call a thing ‘hard’ if it will cause us pain sooner than change
its shape by the pressure of any part of our bodies; and ‘soft’
if an easy and unpainful touch by our bodies can make it
change its shape.
The difference between hard and soft has nothing to do
with solidity: the _hardest_ stone isn’t the least bit more _solid_
than water.
The flat sides of two pieces of marble will more
easily approach each other when there is only water between
them than when there is a diamond between them; but that
is not because the parts of the diamond are more solid than
those of water.
Rather, it is because the parts of the water,
being more easily separable from each other, can easily slide
out of the way as the pieces of marble approach.
If they could
be kept from moving aside in that way, they would—just as
much as the diamond—for ever stop these two pieces of
marble. . . .
If you think nothing but hard bodies can keep
your hands from approaching one another, try that out with
the air enclosed in a football. [Locke then describes an
experiment confirming what he has been saying.]


**5.** This idea of solidity marks off the extension of body from
the extension of space. •The extension of body is just the
cohesion [= ‘holding together’] or continuity of

solid, separable, movable parts;
and •the extension of space is the continuity

of unsolid, inseparable, and immovable parts.
It’s also because bodies are solid that they can bang into



one another, resist one another, and change their shapes.
Many of us think we have clear and distinct ideas, and that
we can think of •pure space, without anything in it that
resists or is pushed around by body.
The idea of the distance
between the opposite parts of a concave surface is just as
clear _without_ as _with_ the idea of solid parts between.
And
we also think we have an idea of •something that _fills_ space,
and can bump other bodies around or be bumped by them.
If there are others who don’t have these two ideas distinct
·from one another· but think they are just one idea, I don’t
know how to talk with them, because they and I have the
same idea under different names or different ideas under the
same name. . . .


**6.** If anyone asks me what solidity is, I send him to his
senses to be informed.
Let him put a flint or a football
between his hands and then try to make the palms meet,
and he’ll know.
If he isn’t satisfied with this explanation of
what •solidity is, I promise to tell him what it is when he
tells me what •thinking is, or explains to me what •extension
or •motion is—a seemingly easier task.
The simple ideas we
have are such as experience teaches to us.
If we try to go
further than that, and to make them clearer in our minds
·by giving verbal definitions·, we shall have no more success
than we would if we tried to _tell_ a blind man what light and
colours are, _talking_ him into having ideas of them.
I shall
explain why this is so later on.


# **Chapter v: Simple ideas of different senses**



The ideas we get by more than one sense are of space, or
extension, shape, rest, and motion; for these are perceivable
by sight and touch.
And we can receive and convey into our



minds the ideas of bodies’ extension, shape, motion, and rest
both by seeing and feeling.
I shall have more to say about
these later.


# **Chapter vi: Simple ideas of reflection**



**1.** After receiving ideas from outside, the mind looks in upon
itself and observes its own dealings with the ideas it already
has, and that gives it further ideas that are as fit to have a
role in its thinking as any of those it received from outward
things.


**2.** The main things the mind _does_, encountered so often
that everyone who wants to can find them in himself, are



perception or thinking, and
volition or willing.
The power of _thinking_ is called the _understanding_, and the
power of _volition_ is called the _will_ ; and these two powers or
abilities in the mind are called ‘faculties’.
I shall later discuss
some of the modes [= ‘special kinds’] of these simple ideas
of reflection, such as remembrance, discerning, reasoning,
judging, knowledge, faith.


# **Chapter vii: Simple ideas of both sensation and reflection**



**1.** Some other simple ideas convey themselves into the mind
by all the ways of sensation and reflection—namely

pleasure or delight, and its opposite:
pain or uneasiness
power
existence
unity.



**2.** Nearly every other idea, whether of sensation or reflection,
is accompanied by either delight or uneasiness.
And almost
any state of our senses caused from outside ourselves, and
any thought of our mind within, can produce pleasure or
pain in us.
By the terms ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ I signify
whatever delights or displeases us, whether it arises from the


thoughts of our minds or anything operating on our bodies.
For whether we call it ‘satisfaction’, ‘delight’, ‘pleasure’,
‘happiness’, etc. on the one side; or ‘uneasiness’, ‘trouble’,
‘pain’, ‘torment’, ‘anguish’, ‘misery’, etc. on the other; they
are merely different degrees of the same thing, and belong to
the ideas of pleasure and pain, delight or uneasiness, these
being the names I shall most commonly use for those two
sorts of ideas.


**3.** The infinite wise author of our being has given us •the
power to move or not move certain parts of our bodies, and
through those movements to move other neighbouring bodies.
And he has also given to our mind •a power often to choose
which of its ideas it will think of, and which line of enquiry
to pursue with consideration and attention.
That is why
he—·God·—has seen fit to accompany various thoughts and
various sensations with a perception of delight.
If delight
were wholly separated from all our outward sensations and
inward thoughts, we would have no reason to prefer one
thought or action to another, prefer negligence to attention,
or prefer movement to rest.
And so we would neither stir
our bodies nor employ our minds, but let our thoughts drift
along without direction or design. . . .
A man in that state,
however equipped with understanding and will, would be
a very idle, inactive creature, and pass his time in a lazy,
lethargic dream. . . .


**4.** Pain is as effective as pleasure in making us active, because we will work as hard to avoid pain as to get pleasure.
It
is interesting to note that pain is often produced by the same
objects and ideas as produce pleasure in us. . . .
Heat is very
agreeable to us in one degree, but becomes extraordinarily
painful when the temperature goes up a little.
And the
most pleasant of all perceptible things, light itself, causes
a very painful sensation if its intensity is too great for our



eyes.
This shows the wisdom of our maker: when any object
acts so intensely on our sense organs that it threatens to
damage their delicate structures, pain warns us to withdraw
before the organ is so damaged as to become useless.
There
is evidence that this is what pain is _for_ .
Although great
light is insufferable to our eyes, yet the highest degree of
darkness does them no harm and isn’t accompanied by pain.
In contrast with that: we are given pain by excess of cold
as well as of heat, because the two extremes are equally
destructive to the bodily condition that is necessary for the
preservation of life and the proper functioning of the body.
It
is the condition of having a moderate degree of warmth—or,
if you will, a motion of the imperceptible parts of our bodies
that is not too fast and not too slow.


[Section **5** suggests another reason, a theological one, why
‘God has scattered up and down various levels of pleasure
and pain in all the things that surround and affect us’.
Section **6** gives a theological reason for discussing this.]


**7.** _Existence_ and _unity_ are two other ideas that are suggested
to the understanding by every object outside us and every
idea within.
When ideas are in our minds, we consider
them as being actually there, i.e. as _existing_ ; and whatever
we can consider as one thing, whether a real being or an
idea, suggests to the understanding the idea of _unity_, ·i.e.
_oneness_ ·.


**8.** _Power_ is another simple idea that we receive from
sensation and reflection.
For we get the idea of power in
two ways: •by observing in ourselves that we can at pleasure
move various parts of our bodies that were at rest, and •by
our constantly observing through our senses the effects that
natural bodies can have on one another.


**9.** Another idea that is suggested by our senses but is more
constantly offered to us by what happens in our minds, is


the idea of _succession_ .
If we look into ourselves and reflect
on what we observe there, we’ll find our ideas following one
another with no interruptions throughout our waking hours.


**10.** I think that these are all—or anyway the most
important—of the mind’s simple ideas, out of which all its
other knowledge is made.
They are all received through
sensation and reflection.
Don’t think that sensation and reflection are too narrow
to supply all the materials of the capacious mind of man,



which takes its flight beyond the stars, roaming beyond the
world of matter out into incomprehensible empty space.
It
won’t seem so strange to think that these few simple ideas
suffice for the quickest thought, or largest mental capacity,
if we consider how many words we can make by putting
together various selections from twenty-four letters, or if we
consider how the mathematicians can get an inexhaustible
and truly infinite stock of material out of just one of the
simple ideas I have mentioned, namely _number_ . [In fact Locke

hasn’t mentioned it yet.
It will be the topic of xvi.]


# **Chapter viii: Some further points about our simple ideas**



**1.** If something in nature can so affect the mind as to cause
some perception in it, that perception will present itself to
the mind as a _positive_ idea, even if it is caused by a _negative_
feature of the object.


**2.** Thus the ideas of heat and cold, light and darkness, white
and black, motion and rest, are equally clear and positive
ideas in the mind; though perhaps some of the causes producing them are mere privations [= ‘absences’, ‘negativenesses’] in
the things from which our senses derive those ideas.
Looking
into those causes is an enquiry that belongs not •to the idea
as it is in the understanding but •to the nature of the things
existing outside us.
These are two very different things, and
we should be careful to distinguish them.
It is one thing
to perceive and know the idea of white or black, and quite
another to examine what kind of surface texture is needed
to make an object appear white or black.




[In section **3** Locke develops this point a little further.
In
section **4** he offers a suggestion about _why_ a negative cause
sometimes ‘produces a positive idea’.]


**5.** I won’t try to settle here whether this suggestion is right.
·As for my point about the idea itself, as distinct from its
cause·, I appeal to everyone’s own experience: the shadow
of a man consists of nothing but the absence of light, but
doesn’t it cause in an observer as clear and positive an
idea as does the man whose shadow it is, even though he is
bathed in sunshine?
And the picture of a shadow is a positive
thing.
We do have negative names that stand directly not for
positive ideas but for their absence.
For example ‘insipid’,
‘silence’, ‘nothing’, and their like denote positive ideas (taste,
sound, being) together with a signification of their absence.


**6.** So a person can be truly said to see darkness. . . .
The
causes I have here assigned for certain positive ideas are


privative [= ‘negative’] according to the common opinion, and
so I have called them; but really it is hard to be sure whether
there really are any ideas from a privative cause, until we
have settled _whether rest is any more a privation than motion_
_is_ .


**7.** To reveal the nature of our ideas better, and to talk about
them intelligibly, it will be convenient to distinguish them •as
they are ideas or perceptions in our minds, and •as they are
states of matter in the bodies that cause such perceptions
in us.
That may save us from the belief (which is perhaps
the common opinion) that the ideas are exactly the images
and resemblances of something inherent in the object. ·That
belief is quite wrong·.
Most ideas of sensation are (in the
mind) no more _like_ a thing existing outside us than the
names that stand for them are _like_ the ideas themselves.


**8.** Whatever the mind perceives in itself—whatever is the
immediate object of perception, thought, or understanding—I
call an _idea_ ; and the power to produce an idea in our mind
I call a _quality_ of the thing that has that power.
Thus a
snow-ball having the power to produce in us the ideas of
white, cold, and round, the powers to produce those ideas in
us, as they are in the snow-ball, I call _qualities_ ; and as they
are sensations or perceptions in our understandings, I call
them _ideas_ .
If I sometimes speak of ‘ideas’ as in the things
themselves, please understand me to mean to be talking
about the _qualities_ in the objects that produce them in us.


**9.** Qualities thus considered in bodies are of two kinds.
First,
there are those that are utterly inseparable from the body,
whatever state it is in.
Qualities of this kind are the ones
that a body doesn’t lose, however much it alters, whatever
force is used on it, however finely it is divided.
Take a
grain of wheat, divide it into two parts, each part has still
solidity, extension, shape, and mobility; divide it again, and



it still retains those qualities; go on dividing it until the parts
become imperceptible, each part must still retain all those
qualities. . . .
I call them original or _primary qualities_ of body,
which I think we may observe to produce simple ideas in us,
viz. solidity, extension, shape, motion or rest, and number.


**10.** Secondly, there are qualities that are, in the objects
themselves, really nothing but _powers to produce various_
_sensations in us by their primary qualities_, i.e. by the size,
shape, texture, and motion of their imperceptible parts.
Examples of these are colours, sounds, tastes, and so on.
I
call these _secondary qualities_ .
To these we can add a third
sort, an example of which is the power of fire to change the
colour or consistency of wax and clay.
This would ordinarily
be said to be _only a power in_ ·rather than _a quality of_ - the
object; but it is just as much a real quality as the powers
that I have called ‘secondary qualities’. (I call them ‘qualities’
so as to comply with the common way of speaking, and add
‘secondary’ to mark them off from the rest.) The primary
qualities of fire—that is, the size, texture, and motion of its
minute parts—give it a power to affect _wax and clay_ etc.;
and those same primary qualities give it a power to produce
in _me_ a sensation of warmth or burning; if the latter is a
quality in the fire, why not the former also?


**11.** The next question is: How do bodies produce ideas in
us?
Obviously they do it by impact; we can’t conceive bodies
to operate in any way but that.


**12.** External objects are not united [= ‘directly connected’] to
our mind when they produce ideas in it, and yet we do
somehow perceive qualities in the objects.
Clearly there
has to be some motion that ·goes from the object to our
sense-organs, and· from there is continued by our nerves
or our animal spirits to the brains or the seat of sensation, there to produce in our mind the particular ideas


we have of them. [Locke held the then-common view that human


physiology involves ‘animal spirits’.
These constitute the body’s hydraulic


system (Bernard Williams’s phrase)—an _extremely_ finely divided fluid

that transmits pressures through tiny cracks and tunnels.] Since the
extension, shape, number, and motion of visible bodies can
be seen from a distance, it is evident that some bodies that
are too small to be seen individually must travel from those
bodies across to the eyes, and thereby convey to the brain
some motion that produces in us these ideas that we have of
them.


**13.** We may conceive that the ideas of secondary qualities are
also produced by the operation of insensible particles on our
senses.
Plainly there are plenty of bodies that are so small
that we can’t, by any of our senses, discover the size, shape,
or motion of any one of them taken singly.
The particles of
the air and water are examples of this, and there are others
still smaller—perhaps as much smaller than particles of air
and water as the latter are smaller than peas or hail-stones.
Let us suppose in the meantime that the different motions
and shapes, sizes and number of such particles, affecting our
various sense-organs, produce in us the different sensations
that we have of the colours and smells of bodies. . . .
It is no
more impossible to conceive that God should attach such
ideas to motions that in no way _resemble_ them than it is that
he should attach the idea [= ‘feeling’] of pain to the motion of a
piece of steel dividing our flesh, which in no way resembles
the pain.


**14.** What I have said about colours and smells applies
equally to tastes and sounds, and other such sensible
qualities.
Whatever reality we mistakenly attribute to them,
they are really nothing in the objects themselves but powers
to produce various sensations in us.
These powers depend,
as I have said, on those primary qualities, namely size, shape,



texture, and motion of parts.


**15.** From this we can easily infer that the ideas of the primary
qualities of bodies resemble them, and their patterns really
do exist in the bodies themselves; but the ideas produced in
us by secondary qualities don’t resemble them at all.
There
is nothing _like_ our ideas ·of secondary qualities· existing in
the bodies themselves.
All they are in the bodies is _a power_
_to produce those sensations in us_ .
What is sweet, blue, or
warm in idea is nothing but the particular size, shape, and
motion of the imperceptible parts in the bodies that we call
‘sweet’, ‘blue’, or ‘warm’.


**16.** Flame is called ‘hot’ and ‘light’; snow ‘white’ and ‘cold’;
and manna ‘white’ and ‘sweet’—all from the ideas they
produce in us. [We know that Locke sometimes calls qualities ‘ideas’,


but that seems not to be enough to explain the oddity of the next sentence


down to its first comma.
The passage as given here is almost verbatim

Locke; all of the oddity is there in what he wrote.] Those qualities
are commonly thought to be the same in those bodies as
those ideas are in us, the one perfectly resembling the other;
and most people would think it weird to deny this.
But
think about this: a fire at one distance produces in us the
sensation of •warmth, and when we come closer it produces
in us the very different sensation of •pain; what reason
can you give for saying that the idea of _warmth_ that was
produced in you by the fire _is actually in_ the fire, without
also saying that the idea of _pain_ that the same fire produced
in you in the same way _is in_ the fire?
Why are whiteness and
coldness in snow, and pain not, when it produces each idea
in us, and can do so only through the size, shape, number,
and motion of its solid parts?


**17.** The particular size, number, shape, and motion of the
parts of fire or snow are really in them, whether or not
anyone’s senses perceive them.
So they may be called _real_


qualities, because they _really_ exist in those bodies; but light,
heat, whiteness or coldness are no more really in them than
sickness or pain is in manna.
Take away the sensation of
them—


let the eyes not see light or colours, or the ears hear
sounds; let the palate not taste, or the nose smell—

and all colours, tastes, odours, and sounds vanish and cease,
and are reduced to their causes, i.e. size, shape, and motion
of parts.


**18.** A big enough piece of manna can produce in us the
idea of a round or square shape, and, by being moved, the
idea of motion.
This idea of motion represents motion as
it really is in the moving manna; a circle or square is the
same •in idea as •in existence—the same •in the mind as
•in the manna—and this motion and shape really are in the
manna, whether or not we notice them.
Everybody agrees
with this.
On the other hand, manna by virtue of the size,
shape, and motion of its parts has a power to produce in
us the sensations of sickness and sometimes of acute pains.
And everyone agrees also that •these ideas of sickness and
pain are _not_ in the manna, are only effects of its operations
on us, and are _nowhere_ when we don’t feel them.
Yet it is
hard to get people to agree that •sweetness and whiteness
aren’t really in manna either, and are also merely the effects
of the operations of manna by the motion, size, and shape
of its particles on the eyes and palate. . . .
It would be hard
for them to explain why the •ideas produced by the eyes
and palate should be thought to be really in the manna,
while •those produced by the stomach and guts are not; or
why •the pain and sickness caused by the manna should
be thought to be nowhere when they aren’t felt, while •the
sweetness and whiteness of it should be thought to exist in
the manna even when they aren’t seen or tasted.



**19.** Consider the red and white colours in porphyry.
Prevent
light from reaching the stone, and its colours vanish, it no
longer produces any such ideas in us; when light returns,
it produces these appearances in us again.
Can anyone
think that any real alterations are made in the porphyry by
the presence or absence of light; and that those ideas of
whiteness and redness are really in porphyry in the light,
when it obviously has no colour in the dark?
The porphyry
has at _every_ time a configuration of particles that is apt to
produce in us the idea of redness when rays of light rebound
from some parts of that hard stone, and to produce the idea
of whiteness when the rays rebound from some other parts;
but at _no_ time are whiteness or redness in the stone.


**20.** Pound an almond, and the clear white colour will be
altered into a dirty one, and the sweet taste into an oily one.
What real alteration can the beating of the pestle make in
any body other than an alteration of the texture of it?


**21.** We are now in a position to explain how it can happen
that the same water, at the same time, produces the idea
of cold by one hand and of heat by the other; whereas the
same water couldn’t possibly be at once hot and cold if those
ideas were really in it.
If we imagine warmth in our hands
to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in
the minute particles of our nerves or animal spirits, we can
understand how it is possible for the same water at the same
time to produce the sensations of heat in one hand and of
cold in the other (which shape never does; something never
feels square to one hand and spherical to the other).
If the
sensation of heat and cold is nothing but the increase or
lessening of the motion of the minute parts of our bodies,
caused by the corpuscles of some other body, we can easily
understand that if motion is greater in one hand than in the
other, and the two hands come into contact with a body that


is intermediate between them in temperature, the particles
in one hand will be slowed down while those of the other will
speed up, thus causing different sensations.


**22.** In what I have been saying I have gone a little further
than I intended into physical enquiries. [That is, into questions


about the biology/psychology of ideas, questions about what _actually_

_happens in the world_ when ideas of a certain kind occur.] But I had to
throw a little light on the nature of sensation, and to provide
a firm grasp of how qualities in bodies differ from the ideas
they produce in the mind; for without this I couldn’t write
intelligibly about ideas.
I hope I shall be pardoned this little
detour into natural science. . . .


**23.** So the qualities that are in bodies are of three sorts.
First,
the size, shape, number, position, and motion or rest of their
solid parts; those are in them, whether or not we perceive
them; and when they are big enough for us to perceive them
they give us our idea of what kind of thing it is—as clearly
happens with artifacts. ·For example, we recognize a clock
or a coach from how its visible parts are assembled, without
need for guesswork about its submicroscopic features·.
I call
these _primary qualities_ .
Secondly, the power that a body has, by reason of its
imperceptible primary qualities, to operate in a special way
on any of our senses, thereby producing in us the different
ideas of various colours, sounds, smells, tastes, etc.
These
are usually called _sensible qualities_ . ·I call them secondary
qualities·.
Thirdly, the power that a body has, by virtue of the
particular set-up of its primary qualities, to change the size,
shape, texture or motion of another body so as to make the
latter operate on our senses differently from how it did before.
Thus the sun has a power to make wax white, and fire to



make lead fluid.
These are usually called _powers_ .
The first of these, I repeat, may be properly called real,
original, or primary qualities, because they are in the things
themselves, whether or not they are perceived.
It is upon
different modifications of them that the secondary qualities
depend. [A ‘modification’ of a quality is a special case of it, a quality


that involves it and more.
Squareness is a modification of shapedness,

which is a modification of extendedness.]
The other two are only powers to act differently on other
things, which powers result from the different modifications
of those primary qualities.


**24.** But though the two latter sorts of qualities are merely
powers, nothing else, one of the two sorts are generally
thought of as something else.
The second sort, namely the
powers to produce ideas in us by our senses, are looked on
as real qualities in the things thus affecting us.
The third
sort are regarded as mere powers: when we consider the
sun in relation to wax that it melts or blanches, we look on
the wax’s whiteness and softness not as qualities in the sun
but as effects produced by powers in the sun. ·This correct
understanding of the third sort of qualities is also right for
the second sort·.
If rightly considered, the qualities of light
and warmth that are perceptions in me when I am warmed
or lit up by the sun are no more _in the sun_ than are the
changes made in the wax when it is blanched or melted. . . .


[Section **25** is a fairly long and somewhat complex explanation of why people are apt to think correctly about powers and incorrectly about secondary qualities.
Section **26**
winds up the chapter without adding anything except the
suggestion that the second sort of qualities ‘may be called
secondary qualities, immediately perceivable’, and the third
sort ‘secondary qualities, mediately perceivable’.]


# **Chapter ix: Perception**



**1.** Just as perception is the mind’s first way of engaging
with ideas, ·the idea of· it is the first and simplest idea we
have from reflection.
Some call it _thinking_, ·but that is a
misnomer, because· in correct English ‘thinking’ stands only
for operations on ideas in which the mind is _active_, coming to
bear on something with some degree of voluntary attention.
In bare naked perception, on the other hand, the mind is
mostly passive, perceiving only what it can’t avoid perceiving.


**2.** What is _perception_ ? you’ll know the answer to that better
by reflecting on what _you_ do when you see, hear, feel, etc. or
think, than by listening to anything I say.
Whoever reflects
on what happens in his own mind can’t miss it; and if he
doesn’t reflect, all the words in the world can’t make him
have any notion of it.


**3.** This much is certain: whatever alterations occur in the
body, if they don’t reach the mind there is no perception.
Whatever impressions are made on the •outward parts, if
they aren’t taken notice of •within there is no perception.
Fire
may burn our bodies with no other effect than it makes on a
piece of wood, unless the motion is continued to the brain,
and there the sense of heat, or idea of pain, is produced in
the mind.
In that consists actual perception.


**4.** Your own experience will tell you that quite often your
mind, while intently focussed on some things and on the
ideas they involve, takes no notice of the effects that other
things are having on the organ of hearing, although these
effects are just like ones that ordinarily produce the idea of
sound.
There may be a sufficient impact on the organ, but
because it isn’t observed by the mind no perception ensues.
The motion that ordinarily produces the idea of sound is



made in the ear, yet no sound is heard.
In this case the
lack of sensation doesn’t come from any defect in your organ
of hearing, or from your ears’ being less affected than at
other times when you do hear.
Rather, it is that the physical
effects aren’t _taken notice of in the understanding_, and so
they don’t imprint any idea on the mind, and so they cause
no sensation.
Whenever there is sense or perception, some
idea is actually produced and present in the understanding.


**5.** So I am sure that children, by the exercise of their senses
on objects that affect them in the womb, receive a few ideas
before they are born. . . .
If I may risk a guess on a matter
that isn’t very open to investigation, I think the ideas of
hunger and warmth are among them—probably among the
first that children have, and hardly ever part with.


**6.** But though we can reasonably suppose that children
receive some ideas before they are born, these •simple ideas
are nothing like the •innate principles that I have rejected.
•The former come from states that the child’s body is in,
or events that its body undergoes, while it is in the womb;
which means that they depend on something exterior to
the mind.
In their way of being produced they differ from
other sense-based ideas _only_ in that they occur earlier.
As
against this, •innate principles are supposed to be of an
entirely different sort—not coming into the mind through
any particular events in the body, but original characters
stamped onto it from the outset.


**7.** As there are some ideas—·like the feelings of hunger and
warmth·—that we can reasonably suppose to be introduced
into the minds of children in the womb, reflecting the necessities of their life in that situation, so the first ideas that


are imprinted on them after they are born are the sensible
qualities that first impinge on them.
_Light_ is a powerful
example.
Newly born children always turn their eyes in the
direction from which the light comes, which is some evidence
of how greedy the mind is to get as many ideas as it can,
so long as they aren’t accompanied by pain.
But children’s
circumstances vary, and so the order in which they acquire
ideas varies too; and this isn’t something we have much need
to enquire into.


**8.** Speaking of adults now: the ideas we receive by _sensation_
are often altered by _judgment_ without our noticing it.
When
we see a round uniformly coloured globe—say of gold or
alabaster or polished coal—it is certain that the idea it
imprints on our mind is of a flat circle variously shadowed,
with various degrees of light and brightness coming to our
eyes.
But we know how convex bodies customarily appear to
us, how the reflections of light are altered by the shapes of
bodies; and so our judgment acquires a habit of immediately
_altering the appearances into their causes_ .
Faced with something that is really a variety of shadow or colour, it infers
what the shape is; takes that variety to be a mark of that
shape; and forms for itself the perception of _a convex figure_
_and a uniform colour_, although the idea we receive is only a
plane variously coloured, as is evident in painting.

A propos of that, I shall here insert a problem that was
put to me by the learned and worthy Mr.
Molineux. . . .:


Suppose a man born blind, now adult, who has
learned how to distinguish by touch between a cube
and a sphere of the same metal and about the same
size, so that he can tell when he handles them which is
the cube and which the sphere.
Now suppose the cube
and sphere to be placed on a table, and the blind man
be made to see.
Can he by his sight, before touching



them, tell which is the globe, which the cube?
To this Mr Molineux answers No.
For though the man has
obtained the experience of how a globe affects his ·sense of·
touch and how a cube does, he still has no experience telling
him that something that affects his touch _thus_ must affect
his sight _so_ .
I agree. . . .
I leave this with you, to prompt
you to consider how much you owe to experience, learning,
and acquired notions, where you have thought you hadn’t
the least help from them!
I especially want to include this
question here because Mr Molyneux tells me that when ·the
first edition of· my book appeared he proposed this question
to various very able men, and found hardly any that gave
what he thinks is the right answer until he convinced them
of it by giving reasons.


**9.** This ·mistake· doesn’t happen much, I think, with ideas
other than those received by sight. ·Here is why it happens
with them·.
Sight, which is the most comprehensive of
all our senses, conveys to our minds the ideas of light
and colours, which we get only from that sense; and it
conveys also the very different ideas of space, shape, and
motion, the variations in which bring with them changes in
the appearances of light and colours; and so we become
accustomed to judging one by the other.
When this is
done with things of which we have frequent experience, it is
performed so constantly and so quickly that we take an idea
formed by our judgment to be a perception of our sensation;
so that the latter serves only to trigger the former, and is
hardly noticed in itself.
Similarly, a man who reads or hears
with attention and understanding takes little notice of the
letters or sounds, attending only to the ideas that they rouse
up in him.


[In section **10** Locke comments on our generally not noticing
that we are making such a substitution.
He explains it partly


as resulting from •the speed with which the substitution is
performed (‘As the mind is thought to take up no space, so its
actions seem to require no time’) and from •its habitualness.
He compares it with our unawareness of blinking.]


**11.** The faculty of perception seems to me to be what
distinguishes the animal kingdom from the inferior parts
of nature, ·that is, from plants·.
A good many plants are
capable of motion: when other bodies are applied to them
they briskly alter their shapes and motions, which leads to
their being called ‘sensitive plants’ because their movements
somewhat resemble those that an animal makes because of
some sensation that it has.
But in plants it is (I suppose)
all bare mechanism, produced in the same kind of way
as. . . .water produces the shortening of a rope—which is
done without any sensation in the subject or any having or
receiving of ideas.


**12.** I believe that perception occurs to some extent in animals
of every sort, though it may be that in some animals the inlets
that nature provides for receiving sensations are so few, and
the perception they are received with is so dark and dull, that
it falls far short of the sharpness and variety of sensation in
other animals.
Still, it is sufficient for, and wisely adapted
to, the state and condition of animals of that sort.
So the
wisdom and goodness of the Maker plainly appear in all the
parts of this stupendous structure, and at all the different
levels of creatures in it.



**13.** Judging by an oyster’s structure, I think we can reasonably conclude that it doesn’t have as many senses—or ones
as keen—as men and many other animals have; and because
of its immobility it wouldn’t be better off if it did.
What good
would sight and hearing do to a creature that couldn’t move
itself towards benefit or away from harm even if it could see
them at a distance?
And wouldn’t keenness of sensation
be an inconvenience to an animal that must lie still, where
chance has once placed it, and be washed over by whatever
water—cold or warm, clean or foul—that happens to come
its way?


**14.** Still, I can’t help thinking that oysters have some small
dull perception that distinguishes their state from perfect
insensibility. [Locke goes on to liken this conjectured state
of an oyster to the state of an extremely old man who has
lost most of his memories, and is blind, deaf, and without a
sense of smell.]


**15.** Because perception is the first step towards knowledge,
and is the inlet through which all its materials come into the
mind, the following is the case. •The fewer senses any man
(or other creature) has, •the fewer and duller the impressions
are that his senses make; and •the duller the faculties are
that he brings to bear on them, •the more remote he is from
having the sort of knowledge that is to be found in some
men.
But there are so many different levels of this (even
amongst men) that we can’t know for sure where a given
species of animals stands in this respect, much less where
an individual animal stands. . . .


# **Chapter x: Retention**



**1.** The next faculty of the mind by which it moves closer
towards knowledge is one that I call ‘retention’—the mind’s
ability to _keep_ simple ideas it has received from sensation
or reflection.
This is done in two ways.
In the first, the
idea is _kept actually in view_ for some time—this is called
‘contemplation’.


**2.** The second kind of retention is the power to _revive_
_again_ in our minds ideas that have come to us and then
disappeared.
This is _memory_, which is the store-house (so
to speak) of our ideas.
Because the narrow mind of man
couldn’t keep many ideas in view and under consideration
at once, it needed a repository in which to store ideas that it
might want to use later on.
But our ideas are nothing but
actual perceptions in the mind, and cease to be anything
when they aren’t perceived; so that this ‘storing of ideas in
the repository of the memory’ really means only that the mind
has a power in many cases to revive perceptions that it has
once had, with attached to them the additional perception
_that it has had them before_ .
It is in this sense that our ideas
are said to be ‘in our memories’, when they are actually
nowhere. . . .


**3.** Attention and repetition help in fixing ideas in the
memory; but the ones that at first make the deepest and most
lasting impression ·are the most likely to be remembered.
And they· are those that are accompanied by pleasure or pain.
The great business of the senses is to alert us to what hurts
the body or brings advantage to it; so nature has wisely
brought it about that pain accompanies the reception of
certain ideas.
That does the work of thinking and reasoning
in children, and acts faster than thinking in adults; and so it



leads both young and old to avoid painful objects, doing this
with the speed that is necessary for their preservation—and
settling in the memory a caution for the future.


[In section **4** Locke discusses ideas that the mind doesn’t
retain in memory—because •the idea was too brief or weak or
uninteresting, or •the memory itself is weak, or •the person
wasn’t paying attention, or •‘through the condition of the
body, or some other fault’.
The section concludes:] In all
these cases ideas in the mind quickly fade, and often vanish
from the understanding altogether, leaving no more signs
of themselves than the shadows of clouds do in flying over
fields of corn; and the mind is as empty of them as if they
had never been there.


**5.** Thus many of the ideas that were produced very early
in the minds of children. . . .if in the future course of their
lives they aren’t repeated they are quite lost, with not a
glimpse of them remaining.
This can be observed in those
who had the bad luck to lose their sight when very young, in
whom the ideas of colours having been only slightly taken
notice of, and have quite worn out because they haven’t
been repeated. . . .
There seems to be a constant decay of all
our ideas, even of those that are most deeply embedded in
the most retentive minds, so that if they aren’t sometimes
renewed by repeated exercise of the senses, or reflection on
the kinds of objects that at first produced them, the print
wears out, and at last there remains nothing to be seen. . . .
The pictures drawn in our minds are laid down in fading
colours, and if they aren’t sometimes refreshed they vanish
and disappear.
I shan’t here go into the question of how far
the structure of our bodies and the constitution of our animal


spirits are concerned in this, and whether the state of the
brain makes the difference ·between good memories and bad,
so· that in some people the memory retains the characters
drawn on it like •marble, in others like •sandstone, and in
others little better than •sand.
It may seem probable that
the constitution of the body sometimes influences ·how well·
the memory ·functions·, since we often find that a disease
can strip the mind of all its ideas, and the flames of a fever
can within a few days burn down to dust and confusion the
images which had seemed to be as lasting as if engraved in
marble.


**6.** But concerning the ideas themselves ·as distinct from
questions about the efficacy of memory·, it is easy to see that
the ideas that fix themselves best in the memory and remain
clearest and longest in it are the ones that are oftenest
refreshed by a frequent return of the objects or events that
produce them.
These include the ideas that are conveyed
into the mind by more ways than one.
And so it is that
•ideas that are of the original qualities of bodies, namely
solidity, extension, shape, motion, and rest, and •ideas ·of
qualities· that almost constantly affect our bodies, such as
heat and cold, and •ideas that are applicable to beings of all
kind, such as existence, duration, and number, which come
along with almost every object that affects our senses and
every thought that occupies our minds—ideas like _these_ are
seldom quite lost except by a mind that loses all its ideas.


**7.** In this secondary perception, so to call it, this viewing
again of ideas that are lodged in the memory, the mind
is often quite active, for the appearance of those dormant
pictures sometimes depends on the will.
The mind often sets
to work searching for some hidden idea, and turns the eye
of the soul (so to speak) upon it [= upon the soul and the ideas it

contains?] .
But sometimes ideas start up of their own accord



in our minds, and present themselves to the understanding;
and very often they are aroused and tumbled out of their dark
cells into daylight by turbulent and tempestuous passions,
because our various states bring to our memory ideas that
would otherwise have lain quiet and unnoticed.
A further point should be noted concerning ideas that are
lodged in the memory and later revived by the mind.
It is that
not only are they _not new_ ideas, but they are _not taken to be_
_new_ by the mind.
On the contrary, it takes notice of them _as_
_of_ a former impression, and renews its acquaintance with
them as with ideas it had known before. . . .


**8.** In a thinking creature, memory is second in importance
only to perception.
It matters so much that when it is lacking
all our other faculties are largely useless.
In our thoughts,
reasonings, and knowledge we couldn’t move beyond present
objects if we didn’t have the help of our memories.
This help
may be defective, in either of two ways.
First, the memory can’t find the idea at all, and to that
extent produces perfect ignorance.
For since we can know a
thing only so far as we have the idea of it, when that is gone
we are in perfect ignorance ·about the thing in question·.
Secondly, the memory moves slowly, and doesn’t retrieve
the stored idea quickly enough to serve the present purpose.
When this happens a lot, that is stupidity; and someone who
through this defect in his memory doesn’t have easy access
to the ideas that really are preserved in his mind—doesn’t
have them ready at hand when he needs them—is hardly
better off than he would be without them ·in his ‘store’·, for
they give him no service. . . .
It is the business of the memory
to provide the mind with those dormant ideas that it needs at
a given moment.
Having them ready at hand on all occasions
is what we call ‘invention’, ‘fancy’, and mental agility.


[In section **9** Locke writes about how men differ from one
another in the strength of their memories, citing Pascal,
who in his prime ‘forgot nothing of what he had done,
read, or thought at any time since he reached the years
of reason’.
He also speculates that probably all men differ
in this respect from angels.
He continues:] Mr.
Pascal’s
memory still had the narrow limits within which human
minds are confined here on earth, having a great variety
of ideas only in succession and not all at once.
Different
grades of angels may have broader views, some of them being
able to retain together, and constantly set before them as
in one picture, all their past knowledge at once.
This would
be a great advantage to the knowledge of a thinking man;
so it may be one of the ways in which the knowledge of
unembodied Spirits greatly surpasses ours.


**10.** Various non-human animals seem to have to a great
degree this capacity for laying up and retaining the ideas
that are brought into the mind.
To take one example out
of several: when birds learn tunes, the attempts one can



observe in them to get the notes right convinces me that they
have perception and retain ideas in their memories, and use
them as patterns.
It seems to me impossible that they should
try to conform their voices to notes (as they plainly do) of
which they had no ideas.
Admittedly, ·a sound might affect
a bird’s behaviour in a purely mechanical manner, without
involving anything mental, e.g. any perception.
For example·,
a sound might mechanically cause a certain motion of the
animal spirits in the brains of those birds while the tune is
actually playing; and that motion might be continued on to
the muscles of the wings, so that the bird is mechanically
driven away by certain noises, because this tends to its
preservation.
But that ·mechanistic, non-mental approach·
couldn’t explain why a sound should mechanically cause
a motion of the bird’s vocal organs that would reproduce
the notes of a sound it had heard earlier; for such imitation
couldn’t be conducive to the bird’s preservation. [Locke adds
another bit of supposed evidence that in learning a tune a
bird relies on its memory.]


# **Chapter xi: Discerning, and other operations of the mind**



**1.** Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that
of _discerning_ and distinguishing ideas from one another.
It
isn’t enough to have a confused perception of some thing in
general—·that is, taking in nothing beyond the bare fact of its
being _a thing_ ·.
If the mind didn’t have different perceptions
of different objects and their qualities, it would be capable
of very little knowledge, even if the bodies affecting us were



as busy as they actually are, and the mind were continually
employed in thinking.
This capacity for distinguishing one
thing from another is the source of the obvious and certain
truth of various propositions, including some very general
ones, that have been taken for innate truths.
Innatists have
been led to their view for want of any other explanation
of why those propositions are universally accepted. ·I am


undercutting them by providing another explanation, an
alternative to the hypothesis of innate imprinting·.
The
acceptance of those propositions depends on the mind’s
ability to _discern_ ·or _distinguish_ ·—its ability to perceive two
ideas to be the same, or to be different.. . . .


**2.** I won’t go into the question of how far failures in
accurately discriminating ideas from one another comes
from •defects in the organs of sense, or •lack of sharpness,
nimbleness or focus in the understanding, or •the way some
people are apt to blunder hastily to conclusions.
I merely
note that this is one of the operations that the mind can
observe in itself when it looks inward.
It is so important to
other knowledge that to the extent that _this_ faculty is dull, or
isn’t rightly used for distinguishing one thing from another,
to that extent our notions are confused and our reason and
judgment are disturbed or misled.
Whereas •having our
ideas in the memory ready at hand is having _mental agility_,
•having them unconfused, and being able to tell one thing
from another even when the difference is small, is much
of what makes up _exactness of judgment and clearness of_
_reason_ .
From this we can perhaps give some reason for the
well known fact that people with a great deal of wit and
prompt memories don’t always have the clearest judgment
or deepest reason. •Wit lies mostly in nimbly putting one
idea together with another idea that it resembles or in some
other way _goes with_, thereby making up pleasant pictures
and agreeable visions in the imagination; whereas •judgment
lies quite on the other side, carefully separating from one
another ideas that differ from one another, however slightly,
so as not to be misled by a similarity into mistaking one thing
for another. [Locke develops this contrast, saying that the
appreciation of wit does not require, and indeed is inimical to,
examination ‘by the severe rules of truth and good reason’.]



**3.** The chief aid to our distinguishing well amongst our ideas
is their being clear and determinate.
When they are so, we
won’t be led into confusion or mistake when, as sometimes
happens, the senses convey ideas from the same object
differently on different occasions, and so seem to err.
Sugar
may taste sweet to a man when he is healthy, and bitter
when he is in a fever; but the idea of _bitter_ in his mind is
as clear, and as distinct from the idea of _sweet_, as if he had
tasted only gall. [The section continues with other examples.]


**4.** _Comparing_ ideas with one with another, in respect of
extent, degrees, time, place, or any other details, is another
operation that the mind performs with its ideas.
On it are
based all the many ideas that fall under the heading _relation_ .
I shall return to them later [xxv]. [For Locke, a ‘comparison’ of one


thing with another needn’t be a _likening_ of them; often it is some other

kind of _considering them together_ .]


**5.** It isn’t easy to determine how far non-human animals
have this capacity ·for comparing·.
I imagine they don’t
have it any great degree; for though they probably have
various ideas that are distinct enough, yet it seems to me
to be the prerogative of human understanding, when it has
distinguished any ·pair of· ideas well enough to perceive
them to be perfectly different and therefore to be _two_, to cast
about and consider how and in what respects they can be
compared—·that is, how they can be related to one another·.
I think, therefore, that non-human animals compare their
ideas only in coping with their physical environment.
We
are probably safe in conjecturing that they don’t at all have
the _other_ power of comparing—the one that men have, and
that belongs to general ideas and is useful only in abstract
reasonings.


**6.** The next operation we can observe the mind performing
with its ideas is _composition_, in which the mind puts together


several simple ideas it has received from sensation and
reflection, combining them into a complex one.
Under
the heading ‘composition’ we may also include _enlarging_,
in which we put together several ideas of the same kind.
Thus by adding several units together, we make the idea of a
dozen; and putting together the repeated ideas of yards, we
make that of a mile.


**7.** In composition also, I suppose, lower animals come far
short of man.
They do take in and retain _together_ various
combinations of simple ideas.
The shape, smell, and voice of
a man may make up his dog’s complex idea of him, or rather
are so many distinct marks by which it recognizes him; but I
don’t think that the dog puts these ideas together to make
a complex idea.
Even where we think a non-human animal
has a complex idea, perhaps it is only one simple idea that
directs the animal in the knowledge of various things that it
doesn’t distinguish visually as much as we imagine it does.
I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse, play
with, and be fond of young foxes, _as much as_ of her puppies
and _in place of_ them, if only you can get them just once to
suckle from her long enough for her milk to go through them.

[The section adds evidence that lower animals can’t count.]


**8.** When children have through repeated sensations got
some ideas fixed in their memories, they gradually begin to
learn the use of signs.
And when they acquire the skill to
apply their organs of speech to producing articulate sounds,
they begin to use words to signify their ideas to others.
They
_borrow_ some of these verbal signs from others; but they also
_make_ some of their own, as we can observe from the new
and unusual names children often give to things when they
first use language.


**9.** So words are used to stand as outward marks of our
internal ideas, which are taken from particular things; but



if every particular idea that we take in had its own special
name, there would be no end to names.
To prevent this,
the mind makes _particular_ ideas received from _particular_
things become _general_ ; which it does by considering them as
they are in the mind—mental appearances—separate from
all other existences, and from the circumstances of real
existence, such as time, place, and so on.
This procedure
is called _abstraction_ .
In it, an idea taken from a particular
thing becomes a general representative of all of the same
kind, and its name becomes a general name that is applicable
to any existing thing that fits that abstract idea.
Such precise
naked appearances in the mind, without considering •how
or •from where or •in company with what others it acquired
them, the understanding stores away for use as _standards_ :
it will classify real things into •sorts on the basis of their
agreement with these patterns ·or standards·.
The abstract
ideas have names commonly attached to them, so that they
also serve as patterns for applying •words, labels, to the
things that they enable us to sort.
Thus you observe the
same colour today in chalk or snow that you yesterday saw
in milk; your mind considers that appearance alone, makes
it a representative of all of that kind and gives it the name
‘whiteness’; and by that sound you signify the same quality,
wherever it is imagined or met with.
This is how _universals_,
whether ideas or words, are made.


**10.** It is _doubtful_ that non-human animals compound
their ideas _much_ ; I am _sure_ that they have no power of
abstracting _at all_, and that the having of general ideas is
what sharply distinguishes humans from other animals, and
is an excellence of which the others are in no way capable.
Obviously, we see no traces in their behaviour of their using
general signs ·to stand· for universal ideas; which gives us
reason to think they can’t abstract, or make general ideas.


**11.** Their having no use or knowledge of general words
can’t be explained as resulting from their lack of appropriate
vocal organs; for we find that many of the lower animals
_can_ make such sounds, and pronounce words distinctly
enough, but they never mean anything general by them.
And
conversely, men who through some physical defect can’t
utter words still manage to express their universal ideas by
signs that they use instead of general words; and we see that
non-human animals can’t do that.
I think we may take _this_
to be what essentially differentiates men from other animals,
a difference that wholly separates them by what eventually
comes to be a vast distance. ·It has often been thought that
the crucial difference is that men alone can _reason_, but that
isn’t right·.
For if lower animals have any ideas at all and
aren’t bare machines (as some think they are), we can’t deny
that they have some reason.
It seems to me as obvious that
some of them sometimes reason as that they have sense;
but when they reason it is only with particular ideas, just as
they received them from their senses ·and not subjected to
abstraction·. . . .


[Sections **12** - **13** discuss the relations between the mental
capacities discussed in this chapter and different kinds of
mental deficiency in humans.
The following passage in **13**
will be referred to in xxxiii.4:] A man who is very level-headed
and has a good mind most of the time may _in one kind_
_of context_ be as frantic as any in the mad-house.
This
can happen because—either through •some sudden very
strong impression, or through •his long fixing his mind on
thoughts of one kind—incoherent ideas have been cemented
together ·in his mind· so powerfully as to remain united
·there·. [The section concludes:] The difference between
_idiots_ and _madmen_ seems to be this: madmen put wrong
ideas together and so make wrong propositions, but argue



and reason correctly from them; but idiots make few if any
propositions, and reason hardly at all.


**14.** The faculties and operations of the mind ·that I have
described in this chapter· are exercised on •all the mind’s
ideas, of whatever kind, but my examples have mainly
involved •simple ideas.
I have gone from my account of
simple ideas ·in chapters ii-viii· directly to my account ·in
chapters ix-xi· of these faculties of the mind, before coming
to what I have to say about •complex ideas.
I have three
reasons for taking the topics in that order.
First, some of these faculties are at first employed principally on simple ideas; so ·in following my order· we can
follow nature in its ordinary method, and thereby track
and reveal the faculties in their rise, progress, and gradual
improvements.
Secondly, simple ideas are usually much more clear,
precise, and distinct than complex ones; so by observing
how the faculties of the mind operate on _them_ we can
•better grasp how the mind abstracts, names, compares
and employs its other operations—•better, that is, than if
we also brought in complex ideas, with which we are much
more liable to make mistakes.
Thirdly, these very operations of the mind relating to ideas
received from sensations are themselves, when reflected
on, another set of ideas—·some of them simple ideas·—
derived from that other source of our knowledge which I
call •reflection; which makes it appropriate to deal with them
immediately after the simple ideas of •sensation.
As for
compounding, comparing, abstracting, etc., I have said very
little about them, because I shall have occasion to treat them
at more length in other places [in III].


**15.** I have given a short and (I think) true account of the first
beginnings of human knowledge: where the mind gets its


first objects [here = ‘ideas’] from, and how it goes about storing
those ideas out of which all the knowledge it is capable of is
to be made.
I must appeal to experience and observation to
decide whether my account is right.
The best way to reach
truth is to examine things as they really are, and not to steer
by fancies that we have worked up for ourselves or have been
taught by others to imagine.


**16.** ·Reverting now to my thesis that ideas enter the mind
only through sensation and reflection·: This is the only way
I can find for ideas to be brought into the understanding.
If other men are sure that _they_ have innate ideas, the rest
of us can’t deny them the privilege that they have over us,
·namely, of knowing what goes on in their own minds·.
I can
only speak of what I find in myself, which fits the account I
have given.
If we examine the whole course of men in their
various ages, countries, and educations, what we shall find
seems to depend on the foundations that I have laid.



**17.** I don’t claim to _teach_, only to _enquire_ .
So let me say
it again: external and internal sensation [= ‘sensation and

reflection’] are the only routes _I can find_ for knowledge to enter
the understanding.
These alone, as far as I can discover,
are the windows through which light is let into this dark
room.
The understanding strikes me as being like a closet
that is wholly sealed against light, with only some little
openings left to let in external visible resemblances or ideas
of things outside.
If the pictures coming into such a dark
room stayed there, and lay in order so that they could be
found again when needed, it would very much resemble the
understanding of a man, as far as objects of sight and the
ideas of them are concerned.
Those are my guesses concerning the means by which
the understanding comes to •have and •retain simple ideas
and their modes, along with •some other operations on them.
I now proceed to examine some of these simple ideas and
their modes in more detail.


# **Chapter xii: Complex ideas**



**1.** So far we have considered only •ideas that the mind
receives passively, namely •the simple ones that come to it
from sensation and reflection.
The mind can’t make any such
simple idea for itself, and can’t have any idea that doesn’t
wholly consist of them.
But while the mind is wholly _passive_
in the reception of all its simple ideas, it _acts_ in various ways
to construct other ideas out of its simple ones, which are
the materials and foundations of all the rest.
The acts in
which the mind exerts its power over its simple ideas are



chiefly these three: **1** Combining several simple ideas into
one compound one; that is how all complex ideas are made.
**2** Bringing together two ideas, whether simple or complex,
setting them side by side so as to see them both at once,
without uniting them into one; this is how the mind gets all
its ideas of relations. **3** Separating them from all other ideas
that accompany them in their real existence; this is called
abstraction, and it is how all the mind’s general ideas are
made.


This shows that the power a man has, and his exercise of
it, are pretty much the same in the intellectual world as in
the material one.
In neither realm has he any power to make
or destroy any raw materials; all he can do is either to •unite
them together, or •set them side by side, or •wholly separate
them. (·For example, he cannot make or destroy rocks, but
he can assemble them to make a wall, or dismantle a wall
that has been made from them·.) I shall begin with _uniting_,
and shall come to the other two in due course.
As simple ideas are observed to exist in various combinations united together, so the mind has a power to consider
several of them united together as one idea; not only in
combinations that exist in external objects, but also in ones
the mind makes up.
Ideas thus made up of several simple
ones I call _complex_ .
Examples are ·the ideas of· beauty,
gratitude, a man, an army, the universe.
These are all
complex ideas made up of simple ones, but the mind can if
it wishes treat each of them by itself as one unified thing,
signified by one name.


**2.** By being able to repeat and join together its ideas, the
mind has great power to vary and multiply the objects of
its thoughts, infinitely beyond what sensation or reflection
provides it with. . . .
The basic raw materials of all its compositions are simple ideas received from those two sources—the
mind has no other way of getting any—but once it has
acquired these simple ideas it can by its own power put
together the ideas it has, making new complex ones that it
never received united in that way.


**3.** Complex ideas, however compounded and decompounded,
are infinitely numerous and endlessly various.
Still, I think
they can all be brought under three headings: **1** Modes. **2**
Substances. **3** Relations.



**4.** First, _modes_ are complex ideas that don’t contain within
them the supposition of •existing by themselves, but are
considered as •dependences on or states of substances.
Examples are the ideas signified by the words ‘triangle’,
‘gratitude’, ‘murder’, etc. (·These words stand for dependences on substances because: if there is a triangle that
is because _something_ is triangular, if gratitude occurs that
is because _someone_ is grateful, if there is a murder that is
because _someone_ murders someone.·) Forgive me if I am
here using the word ‘mode’ in somewhat a different sense
from its ordinary one.
When presenting a view that involves
notions different from any that people commonly have, one
must either invent new words or use old ones with somewhat
new meanings; and in the present case the latter is perhaps
the more tolerable of the two procedures.


**5.** Two sorts of modes deserve to be considered separately.
•Some are only variations or different combinations of the
same simple idea, not mixed in with any other.
For example,
the ideas of _dozen_ and _score_ are nothing but the ideas of
so many distinct units added together.
I call these _simple_
_modes_, because they are contained within the bounds of one
simple idea. ·It should be remembered that a _simple mode_
is, like all modes, a _complex idea_ ·. •Others are made up of
simple ideas of different kinds, put together to make one
complex one.
Examples are _beauty_ (a certain composition of
colour and figure, causing delight to the beholder), and _theft_
(the concealed change of the possession of something without
its owner’s consent, which obviously combines several ideas
of different kinds).
I call these _mixed modes_ .


**6.** Secondly, the ideas of _substances_ are combinations of
simple ideas that are taken to represent distinct particular
things existing by themselves.
In such combinations the
supposed or confused idea of _substance,_ such as it is, is


always the first and chief.
Thus if to the idea of _substance_
we join the simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour, and
·ideas of· certain degrees of weight, hardness, ductility, and
fusibility, we have the idea of _lead_ ; and a combination of
the ideas of a certain shape with mobility, thought, and
reasoning, joined to _substance_, makes the ordinary idea of a
_man_ .
Ideas of substances also fall into two sorts: •ideas of
single substances as they exist separately, for example the
idea of a man or of a sheep; and •ideas of several of those
put together, such as the idea of an army of men, or of a
flock of sheep.
An idea of the latter collective kind—an idea,
that is, of several substances put together—is as much one
single idea as is the idea of a man.



**7.** Thirdly, the last sort of complex idea is the one we call
_relation_, which consists in considering and comparing one
idea with another.
I shall discuss these different kinds
in their order, ·taking simple modes in chapters xii-xxi,
complex or ‘mixed’ modes in xxii, substances in xxiii-xxiv,
and relations in xxv-xxviii·.


[In section **8** Locke makes some wind-up remarks about the
intellectual riches that we can get by operating, in the ways
he has described, on the simple ideas we get from our outer
and inner senses.
He remarks that he’ll illustrate this in his
treatments of ‘the ideas we have of space, time, and infinity
and a few others that _seem_ the most remote from’ simple
sense-based ideas.]


# **Chapter xiii: Simple modes, starting with the simple modes of space**



**1.** I have often mentioned simple ideas, the materials of all
our knowledge, focussing on how they come into the mind.
Now I shall discuss some of them with a different focus: this
time it will be on how they relate to ideas that are more
compounded, looking into the different modifications of the
same idea—modifications that the mind either finds in real
things or makes up on its own initiative. [A ‘modification’ of a


quality is a special case of it, so squareness is a modification of rectan

gularity (see viii.23); and by a natural extension of that usage, the idea

of squareness can be called a modification of the idea of rectangularity.]
Those modifications of a single simple idea (which I call
_simple modes_ ) are as perfectly different and distinct ideas in
the mind as those that are utterly unalike or even contrary
to one another.
For •the idea of _two_ is as distinct from that of
_one_ as _blueness_ is from _heat_ or as either of those is from any
_number_ ; yet •it is made up only of repetitions of the simple
idea of a unit.
Repetitions of this kind joined together make
the distinct simple modes of a dozen, a gross, a million.


[Section **2** merely repeats the point Locke has made in v,
that ‘we get the idea of space both by our sight and touch’.]


**3.** Space considered in terms purely of length between
any two things, without considering anything else between
them, is called _distance_ ; if considered in terms of length,
breadth, and thickness I think it may be called _capacity_ .
The
term _extension_ is usually applied to it whatever manner it
is considered in, ·whether in terms of one or two or three
dimensions·.


**4.** Each different distance is a different modification of space;
and each idea of any distance is a simple mode of this idea. . . .
We have the power of repeating any idea we have of some



distance, and adding it to the first idea as often as we like,
without being ever able to come to any stop.
That lets us
enlarge it as much as we like, which gives us the idea of
_immensity_ [= ‘infinite size’].


**5.** There is another modification of this idea, which is
nothing but the relation that the parts of a boundary have
to one another.
In perceptible bodies whose surfaces come
within our reach, this relation is revealed by the sense of
_touch_ ; and the _eye_ learns about it from bodies and from
·expanses of· colours whose boundaries are within its view.
•Observing how the boundaries terminate either in straight
lines that meet at discernible angles or in crooked lines in
which no angles can be perceived, •and considering these
as they relate to one another in all parts of the boundaries
of any body or space, the mind has the idea that we call
_shape_, which presents it with infinite variety.
For besides the
vast number of different shapes that really exist in coherent
masses of matter, the mind has the power to make perfectly
inexhaustible additions to its stock of ideas, by varying the
idea of space and thereby making new compositions.
It can
multiply shapes ad infinitum, by repeating its own ideas and
joining them as it pleases.


[Section **6** continues with the theme of our freedom to make
ideas of any shapes we like, whether encountered in reality
or not; and adds that we can also form ideas of lengths or
distances that are as long or as short as we please.]


**7.** Another idea that belongs in here is the one we call _place_ .
Whereas in simple _space_ we consider the relation of distance
between any two bodies or points, in our idea of _place_ we
consider the relation of distance between •some thing and


•any two or more points that are considered as staying at
the same distance from one another and thus as staying at
rest.
When we find a thing at the same distance now as it
was yesterday from two or more points that haven’t changed
their relative distance in the interim, we say it has ‘kept the
same place’; whereas if it has perceptibly altered its distance
from either of those points we say that it has ‘changed its
place’. . . .


**8.** ·The idea of a thing’s _place_ is relative, in a manner I now
explain·.
If we find the chess-men on the same squares of
the board that they were when we left them, we say they
are all in the same place, or unmoved, even if the board has
been carried from one room into another.
That is because
we relate them only to the parts of the chess-board, which
stay at the same distance from one another.
The board, we
also say, is in the same place as before if it remains in the
same part of the cabin, even if the ship has been sailing on;
and the ship is said to be in the same place if it keeps the
same distance from the parts of the neighbouring land, even
though the earth has rotated.
So chess-men, board, and ship
have each changed place in respect of more distant bodies
that have kept the same distance from one another. . . .


**9.** This modification of distance that we call _place_ was made
by us for our own use, and we fit it to our convenience.
When
men speak of the ‘place’ of a thing, they do it by reference to
those adjacent things _that best serve their present purpose_,
ignoring other things that might be better determinants of
place for another purpose.
When we are playing chess, it
wouldn’t suit our purpose to locate the pieces in relation to
anything except the squares on the board; but quite different
standards apply when the chess-men are stored in a bag
and someone asks ‘Where is the black king?’ and the right
answer is ‘In the captain’s cabin’.
Another example: when



someone asks in what place certain verses are, he doesn’t
want an answer that names a town or a library or a shelf;
he wants an answer such as: ‘They are at about the middle
of the ninth book of Virgil’s _Aeneid_ ’, which remains true
however often the book has been moved. . . .


**10.** Because our idea of place is merely that of a thing’s
relative position, we can have no idea of _the place of the_
_universe_, though we can of any part of it.
We have no idea of
any fixed, distinct, particular beings, in reference to which
we can imagine the universe to be related by distance.
On
the contrary, beyond it there is only one uniform space or
expansion in which the mind finds no variety, no marks.
To say that the world _is somewhere_ means merely that it
_does exist_ . . . .
Someone who could find out and form a clear
idea of _the place of the universe_ would be able to tell us—·as
in fact obviously nobody can·—whether the universe moves
or stands still in the undifferentiated emptiness of infinite
space!. . . .


**11.** Some philosophers—·led into this by Descartes·—
maintain that _body_ and _extension_ are the same thing.
One
might think they have changed the meaning of one of the
words; but I doubt that, because they have so severely
condemned others for relying on uncertain meanings and
on the deceitful obscurity of doubtful or meaningless words.
Well, then, if they mean by ‘body’ and ‘extension’ the same
as other people do, namely:

_body_ : something that is solid and extended, whose
parts are separable and movable in different ways;
_extension_ : the space that lies between the extremities
of those solid cohering parts, and which is possessed
by them [these are Locke’s exact words],
then they are confounding two very different ideas with one
another.
Isn’t it clear to us all that the idea of _space_ is as


distinct from that of _solidity_ as it is from the idea of _scarlet_
_colour_ ?
Solidity can’t exist without extension; but neither can
scarlet colour exist without extension; this doesn’t prevent
the ideas from being distinct from one another.
Many ideas
require, as necessary to their existence or conception, _other_
ideas, ones that are entirely distinct from them.
Motion can’t
be or be conceived without space, but motion is not space.
Equally distinct from one another, I think, are the ideas of
space and solidity ·and, therefore, the ideas of space and of
body.
That follows because·: solidity is so inseparable an
idea from body that the latter depends on the former for its
filling of space, its contact, impact, and communication of
motion on impact.
If we can—·as some Cartesians do·—infer
that •mind is different from body from the premise that
•thinking doesn’t include the idea of extension in it, we
should be able by parity of argument to conclude that •space
is not body, because •it doesn’t include the idea of solidity in
it.
Here are three reasons why _body_ and _extension_ are two
distinct ideas.


**12.** First, extension doesn’t include solidity or resistance to
the motion of body, as body does.


**13.** Secondly, the parts of pure space are inseparable from
one another; so that the continuity can’t be broken up—
either really or in thought.
One couldn’t possibly break up a
region of space into two separated parts, with two surfaces
where there had been a continuity; and the very _thought_ of
such a separation is impossible, being inconsistent with the
idea of pure space.
I am not denying that one can consider a portion of
space—say a cubic foot of it—without considering the rest;
but that is a partial consideration, not a mental separation,
which is something different. . . .
One may consider light
in the sun without its heat, or mobility in a body without



its extension, without thinking of their separation—·that
is, without thinking of the sun as cold or of the body as
unextended·. . . .


**14.** Thirdly, the parts of pure space are immovable, which
follows from their being inseparable, because motion is
nothing but change of distance between any two things,
and this can’t happen between parts that are inseparable.
Thus the established idea of simple space distinguishes
it plainly and sufficiently from body, since its parts are
_inseparable_, _immovable_, and _without resistance to the motion_
_of body_ ·whereas none of these is true of body·.


**15.** If anyone asks me, _What is this space you speak of?_ I
will tell him when he tells me what his extension is.
For to
say, as is usually done, that being extended is having _parts_
_outside parts_ [Locke puts it in Latin] is to say only that _extension_
_is extension_ .
I learn nothing about the nature of extension
when I am told ‘Being extended is having extended parts that
are exterior to extended parts’.
Compare ‘What is a fibre?’ is
a thing made up of several fibres!’. . . .


**16.** Those who contend that space and body are the
same challenge us with a dilemma ·that they learned from
Descartes·.
Either space is something or it is nothing; if
we say it is nothing, then ·they reply that in that case two
bodies cannot be separated by it, because· if there is nothing
between two bodies they must touch one another.
But if
instead we say that space is something, they demand that
we tell them whether it is body or mind.
I answer their
question with a question: who told them that there could
be nothing but solid beings that can’t think, and thinking
beings that aren’t extended?. . . .


**17.** If someone asks (as people usually _do_ ) whether space
with no body in it is substance or accident [here = ‘property’], I


answer: I don’t know, and I shan’t be ashamed to admit my
ignorance until the challengers show me a clear distinct idea
of substance. ·I shall stay with ‘substance’ for the next three
sections, returning to space in section 21a·.


**18.** I do my best to avoid the fallacies that we tend to fall
into when we take words for things.
It doesn’t help our
ignorance when we _pretend_ to have knowledge by making
meaningless noises.
Made-up names don’t alter the nature
of things, and unless they stand for definite ideas they don’t
enable us to understand things either.
Those who lay so
much stress on the sound of the two syllables _substance_
should ask themselves what is going on when they apply this
word to •the infinite incomprehensible God, to •finite spirits,
and to •body.
Do they apply it in the same sense?
Does it
stand for the same idea when each of those three so-different
beings are called substances?
If it is, does it follow that God,
spirits, and body, agreeing in the same common nature of
_substance_, differ only in having different modifications of
it, comparably with how a tree and a pebble are alike in
having the common nature of _body_ and differ only in having
different modifications of it?
That would be very hard to
swallow.
If instead they say that they apply ‘substance’ to
God, finite spirit, and matter in three different meanings,
expressing three different ideas, they ought to make known
what those distinct ideas are, or at least to give them three
different names, to prevent the confusion and errors that will
naturally follow from the promiscuous use of such a suspect
term.
So far from its having three different meanings, in
ordinary usage ‘substance’ scarcely has _one_ that is clear and
distinct!. . . .


**19.** The philosophers who first rushed into the notion of
_accidents_, as a sort of real beings that needed something
to inhere in, were forced to find out the word ‘substance’



to support them. [In this context an ‘accident’ is a property- _instance_ .


Locke is accusing his opponents of some such thought as this: ‘In this


ball that I hold in my hand there is sphericity, rubberiness, softness,


a certain smell, and so on; that is, there are _this ball’s instances_ of


those general properties; but there must also be something that _has_

them, something that they are properties _of_ .
That must be a substance.’]
Consider the poor Indian philosopher who imagined that the
earth also needed something to hold it up.
If only he had
thought of this word ‘substance’, he wouldn’t have needed
to find an elephant to support the world and a tortoise to
support the elephant: the word ‘substance’ would have met
his needs!
That would have been as good an answer to _his_
question as it is to the question of our European philosophers
who ask what supports a thing’s accidents, and answers that
it is ‘substance’.
We have in fact no idea of what substance
_is_, but only a confused obscure one of what it _does_, ·namely,
it supports accidents·.


[In section **20** Locke continues his attack on ‘substance’,
ending with this sarcastic jibe against the view that accidents
must _inhere_ in a _substance_ :] If the Latin words _inhaerentia_
and _substantia_ were put into the plain English that translates them—‘sticking on’ and ‘under-propping’—it would be
easier for us to see the very great clearness there is in the
doctrine of substance and accidents, and show how useful
they are in deciding of questions in philosophy.


**21a.** [Through a mistake in the original work, this section and the next

were both labelled ‘21’.] Returning now to our idea of space ·and
to the wrongness of identifying it with our idea of body·: I
think everyone will agree that there is not an infinite extent
of matter (‘body’) in the universe.
Well, then, if a man were
placed by God at the edge of the world of bodies, could he
stretch his hand beyond his body?
If he could, then he would
put his arm where there had previously been space without


body; and if he spread the fingers of his outstretched hand,
there would be space between them without body.
If on
the other hand he _couldn’t_ stretch out his hand, that would
have to be because of some external obstacle; and then I ask
whether that obstacle is substance or accident, something
or nothing?
When they (·the Cartesians·) have settled _that_,
they will be able to settle what it is that •can be between
two bodies at a distance and •is not body itself and •has no
solidity.
Anyway, this line of thought ·about _nothing_ ·:

If a body is put in motion and _nothing_ hinders it (as
would be the case beyond the utmost bounds of all
bodies), it can continue to move,
is at least as good as this one:

If there is _nothing_ between two bodies, they must
touch one another.
·Really the former is better than the latter, for· •pure space
between two bodies is sufficient to block the inference to
their being in contact with one another, whereas •bare space
in the way isn’t sufficient to stop motion.
In fact, these men
must either admit that they think body to be infinite (though
they don’t like saying this aloud) or else affirm that space
isn’t body after all.
A thoughtful person can no more have
the thought of a boundary to space than he can think of a
limit to time; if anyone’s idea of eternity is infinite, so is his
idea of immensity; either time and space are both finite or
they are both infinite.


**21b.** Furthermore, those who assert the impossibility of
space existing without matter must not only make body infinite but must also deny that God has a power to annihilate
a part of matter.
Presumably no-one will deny that God
could put an end to all motion, keeping all the bodies in the
universe completely immobile for as long as he pleased.
Well,
then, if you allow that God could, during such a period of



universal rest, annihilate the book you are now reading, you
must also admit the possibility of a vacuum, for the space
that was filled by the annihilated book would still exist, and
would be a space without body.
For the surrounding bodies,
being perfectly still, make a diamond-hard wall through
which no other body can possibly get in.
Indeed, the supposition of plenitude—·i.e. that the universe is full·—has the consequence that if a particle of matter
is removed another particle must move in to take its place.
But ·plenitude is only an unsupported supposition, which·
needs some better proof than a _supposed_ matter of fact
which experiment can never establish. ·And it can’t be
accepted on conceptual rather than matter-of-fact grounds,
for· our own clear and distinct ideas plainly satisfy us that
there is no necessary connection between space and solidity,
since we can conceive the one without the other. [Locke then
repeats a point from iv.3: anyone who joins in the debate
over plenitude as a matter-of-fact issue thereby commits
himself to having distinct _ideas_ of space and of matter or
body.]


**22.** Without thinking about the edge of the material world,
and without appeal to God’s omnipotence, we get evidence
for the existence of a vacuum from the motion of bodies that
we see in our own neighbourhood.
I defy anyone to divide
a solid body so as to make it possible for the solid parts to
move up and down freely every way within the bounds of
that surface, without leaving in it an empty space as big as
the smallest part into which he has divided the body. [Locke
goes on to say, with some eloquence, that this reasoning
applies at any size-level you care to choose.]


**23.** But my topic was the question whether the idea of space
or extension is the same as the idea of body; and to answer
No to this it isn’t necessary to prove the _real existence_ of a


vacuum.
All that is needed is that we have the _idea_ of it,
and it is plain that men have that—·i.e. the idea of vacuum,
or space without body·—when they argue about whether
or not there is a vacuum.
If they didn’t have the idea of
space without body, they couldn’t make a question about its
existence. . . .


[In section **24** Locke offers a suggestion about _why_ the
Cartesians made their mistake. (The better Cartesians, that
is; he is rude about the others.) By sight and by touch, he
says, the extension of bodies is forced in on us all the time,
so it has come to dominate the thinking of the Cartesians,
seducing them into thinking that none of the other properties
of bodies could exist in the world except as properties of
extended things.
He concludes:] If they had reflected on their
ideas of •tastes and smells, as much as on those of •sight
and touch, they would have found that the former didn’t
include in them any idea of extension.
Extension is just one
affection [= ‘property’] of body—one among others—and it is
discoverable by our senses, which are hardly acute enough
to look into the pure essences of things. ·The Cartesian view,
remember, is that extension is _the whole essence of_ body·.


[Section **25** presents a mild philosophical joke: the sort of
thinking the Cartesians seem to have done should lead one
to conclude that _‘unity_ is the essence of every thing’ because
every thing is an instance of it—i.e. is _one_ .]


[In section **26** Locke repeats his main case against the
Cartesian view.
He also mentions, but doesn’t answer, the
question of whether space is •‘only a relation resulting from
the existence of other beings at a distance’ or whether instead
it is •a kind of container.
He declines to take sides on
that question.
He ends by suggesting some terminology,
including this:] To avoid confusion it might be helpful if the
word ‘extension’ were applied only to matter, or the distance



between the boundaries of particular bodies, and the term
‘expansion’ were used for space in general, with or without
solid matter possessing it. . . .


**28.** ·That last suggestion points to a more general issue
that will loom large in Book III, but which warrants one
section here·.
Knowing precisely what our words stand for
would, I imagine, quickly end this dispute and very many
others.
For I am inclined to think that when men come to
examine their simple _ideas_ they find them generally to agree,
though in conversation they may confuse one another by
using different _names_ .
I imagine that men who abstract
their thoughts ·from the words in which they express them·,
and examine well the ideas of their own minds, can’t differ
much in their •thinking, however much they may puzzle one
another with •words, which they use according to the ways
of speaking of the various schools or sects they grew up in.
Though amongst unthinking men who don’t scrupulously
and carefully examine their own ideas, and don’t peel them
off from the words men use for them, but rather confound
them with words, there is bound to be endless dispute,
wrangling, and jargon; especially if they are learned bookish
men who are devoted to some sect, and have learned to
parrot its way of talking.
But if any two _thinking_ men really
had different ideas, I don’t see how they could converse or
argue one with another.
Don’t misunderstand me.
The sort of ideas I am speaking
of don’t include every floating imagination in men’s brains.
It
isn’t easy for the mind to put off those confused notions and
prejudices it has absorbed from custom, carelessness. and
ordinary talk.
It requires trouble and concentration for the
mind to examine its ideas far enough to resolve them into
the clear and distinct simple ideas out of which they have
been compounded, and to see which of its simple ones have
a necessary connection with which others. . . .


# **Chapter xiv: Duration and its simple modes**



**1.** There is another sort of distance or length the idea of
which we get not from the permanent parts of _space_ but from
the fleeting and perpetually perishing parts of _succession_ .
This we call _duration_ ; its simple modes are the different
lengths of it of which we have distinct ideas—hours, days,
years, etc., and time and eternity.


**2.** A great man—·St.
Augustine·—when asked by someone
what time is, answered: ‘When you don’t ask me, I know
what it is’ [Locke gives this in Latin], which amounts to this: ‘The
more I set myself to think about it, the less I understand
it.’ This might lead one to think that time, which reveals all
other things, is itself not to be discovered.
Duration, time,
and eternity are plausibly thought to have something very
abstruse in their nature.
But if we trace these ideas right
back to their origins in _sensation_ and _reflection_, one of _those_
will be able to make these ideas as clear and distinct to us as
many others that are not thought to be so obscure. ·Among
other things·, we shall find that the idea of _eternity_ itself is
derived from the same origin as the rest of our ideas.


**3.** To understand _time_ and _eternity_ correctly, we should
attend to the nature of our idea of _duration_, and to how
we came by it.
Anyone who observes what happens in his
own mind must realize that there is a sequence of ideas
constantly following one another in his mind, as long as he
is awake.
Reflection on these appearances of various ideas
one after another in our minds is what provides us with
the idea of _succession_ ; and the distance between any two
parts of that sequence, or between the appearance of any
two ideas in our minds, is what we call _duration_ .
For while
we are thinking, or while we receive successively various



ideas in our minds, we know that we exist; and so we call the
existence (or the continuation of the existence) of ourselves
our ‘duration’.
We also speak of the duration of other things
that coexist with our thinking.


**4.** We don’t perceive duration except when we attend to
the sequence of ideas that take their turns in our understandings; which convinces me that our notion of succession
and duration comes from _reflection_ . [When Locke writes a phrase


like ‘a succession of ideas’, this text replaces ‘succession’ by ‘sequence’.


In phrases like ‘our notion of succession’, the word ‘succession’ is left

alone.] When the sequence of ideas ceases, our perception
of duration ceases with it—as everyone finds from his own
experience of sleeping for any period of time, long or short.
While he is sleeping and not thinking, he has no perception
at all, and the duration of his sleep is quite lost to him; there
seems to him to be no ·temporal· distance from the moment
he stops thinking to the moment he starts again.
I am sure
that it would be just like that for a man awake, if he could
keep only one unvarying idea in his mind.
We do in fact see
that someone who fixes his thoughts very intently on one
thing, not attending much to the sequence of ideas that pass
in his mind, lets slip out of his account a good part of that
duration and thinks the time that has passed is shorter than
it really is. [Locke adds the point that even a sleeping man
retains a sense of time passing if he dreams; which he takes
as confirmation of his view.]


**5.** Someone who has in this way acquired the notion or
idea of duration, can apply it to things that exist while he
isn’t thinking; just as someone who has acquired the idea of
extension from bodies through his sight or touch can apply


it to distances where no body is seen or felt.
That enables
a man to judge how much time has passed while he was
asleep and not dreaming.
Having observed the revolution
of days and nights, and found the length of their duration
to appear regular and constant, he can suppose that this
revolution went on in the same way while he was sleeping as
it did at other times, and this will give him a measure of how
long he slept.
But if Adam and Eve (when they were alone
in the world), instead of their ordinary night’s sleep, had
passed a whole twenty-four hours in one continued sleep,
the duration of those twenty-four hours would have been
irrecoverably lost to them.


**6.** If you think that we get the notion of succession from
•sensation rather than •reflection, then consider this: the
motion of external bodies produces an idea of succession
in your mind only to the extent that it produces there a
continued series of distinguishable ideas.
A man becalmed
at sea may look on the sun, or the sea, or his ship for a
whole hour, during which time two and perhaps three of
those objects have moved, but because •he hasn’t perceived
their motion he doesn’t get from them any sense of duration,
·i.e. of time passing·.
But if during this hour of quiet he
has been thinking, •he will perceive the various ideas of his
thoughts appearing one after another in his own mind, and
thereby find _succession_ where he could observe no _motion_ .


**7.** I think this is why very slow uniform motions are not
perceived by us.
In such a case, the change of relative
distance is so slow that it causes no new ideas in us—or
only ones that are widely separated in time—and so we don’t
have a constant series of new ideas following one another
immediately in our minds, and thus have no perception of
motion. . . .



**8.** On the other side, things that move very swiftly are also
not perceived to move.
It is because they don’t affect the
senses distinctly with the distinguishable distances of their
motion [the last five words are Locke’s], and so don’t cause any
sequence of ideas in the mind.
When we see a thing moving
around in a circle in less time than our ideas ordinarily
succeed one another in our minds, we don’t perceive it to
move, and see it rather as a perfect unbroken circle of that
matter or colour, and not a part of a circle in motion.


**9.** I conjecture (you decide for yourself) that while we are
awake our ideas succeed one another in our minds at certain
distances, somewhat like the images inside a lantern that
are turned around by the heat of a candle.
Their appearance
in sequence may be sometimes faster and sometimes slower,
but I guess that it doesn’t vary much in a waking man.
There
seem to be limits to how quickly and to how slowly ideas can
succeed one another in our minds.


**10.** My reason for this odd conjecture is my observation
that in the impressions made on any of our senses we can
perceive succession only within limits.
If the sequence of
impressions is exceedingly fast, the •sense of succession is
lost, even in cases where it is obvious that there _is_ a •real
succession.
Suppose that a cannon-bullet shoots across a
room, on its way ripping off someone’s leg: it couldn’t be
clearer that it must _successively_ strike the two sides of the
room, and that its damage to the victim must occur _between_
those two events.
And yet I don’t think that anybody who
felt the pain of such a shot and heard the blows against the
two walls would perceive any succession in these events.
A
stretch of time like this, in which we perceive no succession,
is what we call _an instant_ .
It is that which takes up the time
of _only one idea in our minds_ .


**11.** This also happens when the motion is very slow, not


providing the mind with a constant series of fresh sensory
ideas as fast as the mind is capable of receiving them.
In
these cases, •other ideas _of our own thoughts_ can insert
themselves into our minds between •the ideas offered to our
senses by the ·slowly· moving body.
So the sense of motion
is lost.
Although the body really does move, its •changes
of perceivable distance from some other bodies is slower
than the rate at which •ideas of our own minds—·ideas of
reflection·—naturally follow one another in sequence.
The
thing therefore seems to stand still; as is evident in the hands
of clocks and shadows of sun-dials, and other constant but
slow motions. . . .


**12.** It seems to me, then, that the constant and regular
succession of ideas in a waking man is the measure and
standard—so to speak—of all other successions. [The remainder of this section repeats the content of sections 10
and 11.
Locke will take up temporal measurement in section
17 and run with it to the end of the chapter.]


**13.** Someone may say: ‘If the ideas of our minds constantly
change and shift in a continual succession, it would be
impossible for a man to think long about any one thing.’ If
this means that a man can’t have one single idea for a long
time alone in his mind, with no variation, I agree that it isn’t
possible.
The only reason I can give for this opinion is an
appeal to experience; and I invite you to try whether you
can keep one unvaried single idea in your mind, without any
other, for a considerable period of time. ·I can’t give a deeper
and more explanatory reason for my view, because I lack the
knowledge that this would require·.
I don’t know how the
ideas of our minds are made, or what they are made of, or
what lights them up for us, or how they come to make their
appearances.




[In sections **14–15** Locke predicts the difficulties that will
confront anyone who accepts his ‘try it for yourself’ challenge.
Section **16** repeats the thought of section 6, namely that
the motions of bodies support our idea of succession only
_through_ the succession of ideas they cause in us.]


**17.** Once the mind has acquired the idea of duration, the
next thing it is natural for it to do is to get some _measure_ of
this common duration, by which to judge its different lengths
and think about the order in which various events occur.
Without this, much of our knowledge would be confused,
and much of history would be useless.
When duration is
considered as broken up into measured periods, the proper
name for it is ‘time’.


**18.** To measure extension we need only to apply our
standard or measure to the thing we are measuring—·for
example, laying a tape-measure along a length of cloth·.
But
in measuring duration we can’t do that, because no two parts
of a sequence can be laid alongside one another.
And nothing
can measure duration except duration (just as nothing can
measure extension except extension); but we can’t keep by
us any standing unvarying measure of duration, as we can of
certain lengths of extension, marked out in durable material
things.
All we are left with for a convenient measure of
time is the dividing up of long periods into _apparently_ equal
portions, ·these being measured· by constantly repeated
kinds of event.
Portions of duration that aren’t thought of as
distinguished and measured by such periods aren’t strictly
speaking instances of _time_, and we reflect this in phrases
like ‘before all time’ and ‘when time shall be no more’.


[Sections **19–20** make and defend the following point: Although in our civilisation we measure time by movements,
e.g. those of the earth around the sun, it is a mistake to
think—as some philosophers have—that time and motion are


essentially tightly linked to one another.
All the measuring
of time requires is regular periodic events _of some kind_ ; they
need not be movements.
Locke gives examples of other
standards for the measurement of time.]


**21.** ‘Without a regular motion such as the sun’s’, it may be
demanded, ‘how could it ever be known that such periods
were equal?’ I answer that the equality of any other periodic
events could be known in the same way that days were
known or presumed to be equal at first—namely, through
judging them in terms of the contemporaneous series of
ideas that had passed in men’s minds. [Locke develops this
point in a long discussion of which the following episodes are
especially notable.] We must carefully distinguish duration
itself from the measures we make of it.
Duration in itself
is to be considered as going on in one constant, equal,
uniform course; but none of our bases for measuring it
can be known to do so. . . .
If anyone should ask us how
we know that the two successive swings of a pendulum
are equal, it would be hard to satisfy him that they are
infallibly so. . . .
Since no two portions of a sequence can
be brought together, it is impossible ever certainly to know
their equality.
All we can do for a measure of time is to
take such ·kinds of events· as have continual successive
appearances at _seemingly_ equidistant periods.
And of this
seeming equality we have no measure except the sequence of
our own ideas, with some confirmation from other probable
reasons, to persuade us of their equality.


[In section **22** Locke criticises the view that ‘time should be
_defined_ to be the ‘measure of motion’, bringing against it the
points made in sections 19–20, and adding one further point,
namely that •time has no more right to the label ‘measure of
motion’ than •space has.]




[In section **23** Locke contends that there is no necessity
about any of the measures of duration that we happen to
use—minutes, hours, days, etc.
We could adopt any others
that satisfied the requirement of ‘regular periodical returns’.


**24.** Once the mind has acquired a measure of time such as
the annual revolution of the sun, it can apply that measure
to durations in which that measure didn’t exist.. . . .
The idea
of duration equal to an annual revolution of the sun is as
easily applicable in our thoughts to duration where no sun or
motion was, as the idea of a foot or yard, taken from bodies
here, can be applied in our thoughts to distances beyond the
confines of the world, where are no bodies at all.


[Section **25** expands this point a little.]


**26.** If it is objected that in my account of time I have
illegitimately assumed that the world is neither eternal nor
·spatially· infinite, I answer that my present purposes don’t
require me to _argue_ that the world is finite in duration and
extension.
That it _is_ so is at least as conceivable as that
it _isn’t_, so I am as entitled to assume the finiteness of the
world as anyone is to suppose the contrary. ·As regards
conceivability·: I am sure that anyone who tries it will easily
conceive in his mind the beginning of motion, and so may
come to a stop—a go-no-further—in his consideration of
motion; but he can’t in the same way conceive a beginning
of all _duration_ .
So also in his thoughts he can set limits
to body, but not to _space_ .
The utmost limits of •space and
•duration are beyond the reach of thought, as are also the
utmost limits of •number—and all for the same reason, as
we shall see later.


**27.** The origin of our idea of time also gives us the idea of
_eternity_ .
Here is how.
Having acquired the idea of succession
and duration in the manner I have described, and having


from the revolutions of the sun acquired the ideas of certain
lengths of duration, we can in our thoughts add such lengths
of duration to one another as often as we please, and apply
the results of that addition to durations past or future.
We
can continue to do so without bounds or limits, proceeding
ad infinitum.This lets us apply the length of the sun’s annual
motion to a duration before there was any sun or any motion;
which is no more difficult or absurd than to apply my notion
of one hour, based on the moving of a shadow on a sun-dial,
to the duration of the burning of a candle last night, which
is now absolutely separate from all actual motion.
All this
requires is the thought that if the sun _had_ been shining on
the dial at that time, its shadow _would have_ moved from one
hour-line to the next while the candle’s flame lasted.


[In sections **28–9** Locke develops the idea that we can have
the thought of determinate periods of time before there
were any events by which to measure it.
The crux is this,
from **29** :] For measuring the duration of anything by _time_,
the thing need not be co-existent with any motion that we
use for temporal measurement, or indeed with _any_ periodic
revolution ·of a kind we _could_ use for such measurement·.
All we need is to have _the idea of_ the length of some regular
periodical appearances, an idea that we can in our minds
apply to durations with which the motion or appearance
never co-existed.



**30.** . . . .I can imagine that light existed _three days_ before the
sun existed and moved, by having this thought:

The duration of light before the sun was created was
of a length such that: if the sun _had_ been moving
then as it does now, it _would have_ been equal to three
of its daily revolutions.
. . . .In this way I can have the thought of something’s being
the case a minute, an hour, a day, a year, or a thousand
years before there were any moving bodies ·or any other
regular periodic events·.
For I need only to consider duration
equal to one minute, and then I can add one minute more,
·and so on· until I come to sixty; and by the same way
of adding minutes, hours, or years,. . . .I can proceed ad
infinitum.
That involves supposing •a duration that exceeds
as many such periods as I can count, however long I go
on; and I think that is the notion we have of •eternity.
The
infiniteness of eternity involves the same idea as we have
for the infiniteness of number, to which we can add for ever
without end.


**31.** And thus I think it is plain that we get our ideas of
duration, and our measures of it, from the two fountains of
all knowledge that I have spoken of—reflection and sensation.

[Then Locke swiftly recapitulates the six main topics of this
chapter: idea of succession, idea of duration, measure of
duration, thought of determinate lengths of duration when
no measure exists, idea of eternity, idea of ‘time in general’.]


# **Chapter xv: Duration and expansion, considered together**



**1.** Though I have dwelt pretty long on the topics of space
and duration, I shall stay with them, comparing them with
one another.
They are important, and also in some ways
abstruse and peculiar; and we may be helped to get a clear
understanding of them by considering them together.
I shall
use the term ‘ _expansion_ ’ for the most general and abstract
notion of space, because ‘extension’ for some people involves
some thought of extended bodies. . . .
In both _expansion_ and
_duration_ the mind has the common idea of continued lengths,
capable of greater or less quantities; for we have as clear an
idea of •how an hour differs from a day as we have of •how
an inch differs from a foot.


**2.** The mind, having acquired the idea of the length of any
part of expansion, can repeat it as often as it wants, moving
out to the distance of the sun or of the remotest star.
In
moving out in this way the mind encounters nothing to stop
its going on, inside the material world or beyond it.
We can
easily in our thoughts come to •the end of solid extension:
•the outer edge of all body we can easily arrive at ·in our
thought·.
But when the mind is there, it finds nothing to
hinder it from moving on into the endless expansion beyond;
of _that_ it can’t even conceive any end.
Don’t say ‘Beyond the
bounds of body there is _nothing at all_ ’, unless you are willing
to confine God within the limits of matter. . . .


**3.** Similarly with duration: having acquired the idea of
some length of duration, the mind can double, multiply, and
enlarge it—beyond the existence of all bodies and all the
measures of time taken from the great bodies of the world
and their motions.
Yet everyone readily admits that although
we rightly make duration boundless we cannot extend it



beyond all being.
We all agree that God fills eternity; and
(·returning for a moment to the last topic of section 2·) it is
hard to find a reason for anyone to doubt that God likewise
fills immensity.
His infinite being is certainly as boundless
in one way as in the other; and to say that _where there is_
_no body there is nothing at all_ is, I think, to give too much
importance to matter.


[In section **4** Locke says that many people who are sure that
time is infinite hesitate to say the same about space, and he
suggests a reason.
It is because we think of both time and
space—or, more strictly, duration and expansion—as states
or properties of some being, some _thing_ ; where duration is
concerned, the thing can be God; but we don’t think of God
as extended, and so where space is concerned we are apt to
think that it stops where matter stops because beyond the
edge of the material world there is no _thing_ for space to be an
attribute of.
Here Locke interpolates some thoughts about a
likeness between the Latin roots of the words for ‘enduring’
and for ‘hard’.
Then, returning to his main thought in this
section:] But be that as it may, it is certain that anyone
who pursues his own thoughts will find that they sometimes
launch out beyond the extent of body into the infinity of space
or expansion, the idea of which is distinct and separate from
body and all other things.


**5.** _Time_ in general is to _duration_, as _place_ is to _expansion_ .
Time and place are such portions of those boundless oceans
of eternity and immensity as have been set out and distinguished from the rest, as it were by land-marks. [The
remainder of this section elaborates that a little.]


**6.** ‘Time’ and ‘place’, taken thus ·to stand· for determinate
distinguishable portions of those infinite abysses of space
and duration that are supposed to be marked off from the
rest by known boundaries, have each of them a double
meaning.
First, _time_ in general is commonly taken for that part
of infinite duration that is measured by, and co-existent
with, the motions of the great bodies of the universe.
In
that sense time begins and ends when this sensible world
begins and ends—see iv.18.
_Place_ is also sometimes taken
for that portion of infinite space that is occupied by the
material world, and is thereby distinguished from the rest
of expansion (though this is better called ‘extension’ than
‘place’). . . .


**7.** Secondly, sometimes ‘time’ is used in a broader sense,
and is applied not only to parts of that infinite duration that
were really distinguished and measured out by periodical
motions of bodies that we use as our measures of time, but
also to other portions of it that we suppose to be equal to
certain lengths of measured time—thus considering them as
bounded and determined ·even if they were really not so·.
In this spirit we might say ‘Angels were created 7640 years
before the world was’, thereby marking out as much of that
undifferentiated duration as we suppose would have allowed
7640 annual revolutions of the sun if it moved at its actual
rate.
Likewise we sometimes speak of _place_, _distance_, or
_volume_ in the great emptiness beyond the edge of the world,
when we pick out in thought an amount of it that could
contain a body of any assigned dimensions, such as a cubic
foot; or suppose a point in it at such-and-such a distance
from a given part of the ·material· universe.


**8.** _Where?_ and _When?_ are questions that can be asked
about any finite existent, and we always answer them in



terms (·for _Where?_ ·) of relations to some known parts of •this
perceptible world and (·for _When?_ ·) of relations to certain
periods marked out to us by the motions observable in •it.
Without some such fixed parts or periods, our finite minds
would be lost in the boundless invariable oceans of duration
and expansion. [Locke then adds details to this comparison
between expansion and duration, space and time.]


**9.** Space and duration are greatly alike in another way,
namely that although they are rightly counted as •simple
ideas, every distinct idea we have of either of them involves
some •composition ·because· it is the very nature of each to
consist of parts.
Still, they are entitled to count as simple
ideas, because their parts are all of the same kind, involving
no mixture of any other idea.
If the mind could (as with
number) reach the thought of a part of extension or duration
that is too small to be divided, that would be the indivisible
unit or idea by repetition of which the mind would make its
more enlarged ideas of extension and duration.
But since
the mind can’t form an idea of any space without parts, it
instead makes use of common measures such as inches and
feet, and repeats _them_ to get ideas of larger extents. ·And
similarly with time·. [Locke continues with remarks about
the ‘obscure and confused’ ideas that we have of very large or
very small amounts of space or time. (The idea of _ten million_
_cubic miles_ isn’t clear, though its _ten million_ component is
so.) He observes that we have a rough and ready idea of a
minimum amount of time or of space—namely the smallest
amount of which we can form a clear and distinct idea.]


[In section **10** Locke likens expansion to duration in this:
both have parts, but it makes no sense to think of either of
them as being taken apart.]


**11.** Here is a manifest difference between expansion and
duration.
The ideas of •length that we have can be turned


in every direction, and so make shape, and breadth, and
thickness; whereas •duration is like the length of one straight
line, extended ad infinitum, and not capable of multiplicity,
variation, or shape.
Duration is something of which all
things, while they exist, equally partake.
For _this present_
_moment_ is common to all things that are now in being, and
contains that ·present· part of their existence,. . . .and we
may truly say that they all exist in the same moment of time.
Whether angels and Spirits have any analogy to this in
respect to expansion is beyond my comprehension.
Our
understandings and comprehensions are suited to our own
survival and the purposes of our own lives, but not to the
reality and extent of all other things.
So it is nearly as hard
for us to conceive of any real being with a perfect negation
of every kind of expansion as it is to have the idea of a real
being with a perfect negation of every kind of duration.
So we
don’t know ·and can’t even think about· what •Spirits have
to do with space, or how they relate to one another in it.
All
that we know is that each •body possesses its own portion
of it, according to the extent of its solid parts, excluding all
other bodies from that portion of space for as long as it is
there.


**12.** Duration—and time, which is a part of it—is the idea
we have of _perishing distance, of which no two parts exist_
_together_, but follow each other in sequence; and expansion is
the idea of _lasting distance, all of whose parts exist together_,
and are not capable of succession. [By ‘perishing distance’ Locke



seems to mean the ever-shrinking temporal distance between the present

time and some future event.] ·Because our idea of duration is as
it is·, we can’t get our minds around the thought of a being
that •now exists tomorrow, or that •now has more than the
present moment of duration.
Yet we can conceive God’s
eternal duration as being far different from ours and any
other finite being’s.
Our knowledge and power don’t range
over all past and future things; our thoughts are only of
yesterday, and we don’t know what tomorrow will bring.
We
can never bring anything back once it is past; and we can’t
make present what is yet to come.
What I say here about
_us_ I say of _all finite beings_ .
Even ones that far exceed man
in knowledge and power are still no more than the meanest
creature in comparison with God.
Something finite, however
great and grand it is, stands in no proportion to what is
infinite.
Because God’s infinite duration is accompanied
by infinite knowledge and infinite power, he sees all things
past and to come; and they are no more distant from his
knowledge than the present.
And there is nothing that he
can’t make exist whenever he likes.
For the existence of all
things depends on his good pleasure, so all things exist at
every moment that he thinks fit to have them exist.
A final remark: expansion and duration _contain_ each
other: every part of space is in every part of duration, and
every part of duration is in every part of expansion.
In all
the great variety of our thoughts, this combination of two
distinct ideas seems to have almost no equal.
It may be
worth thinking about further.


# **Chapter xvi: Number**


**1.** Among all the ideas that we have, none is •suggested
to the mind by more ways, and none is •more simple, than
the idea of _unity_ or _one_ .
It •hasn’t a trace of variety or
composition in it; and •every object that our senses are
brought to bear on, every idea in our understandings, every
thought of our minds, brings this idea along with it.
This
makes it the most intimate to our thoughts, and also the
most universally applicable idea that we have.
For _number_
applies itself to men, angels, actions, thoughts, everything
that exists or can be imagined.


**2.** By repeating this idea in our minds, and adding the
repetitions together, we come by the complex ideas of its
modes. [Here and in many later passages, ‘mode’ means what ‘modifi

cation’ meant earlier, e.g. in xiii.1, namely ‘special case’, so that _two_ is

a mode of _number_ .] Thus by adding one to one we have the
complex idea of a couple; by putting twelve units together
we have the complex idea of a dozen; and so on for any other
number.


**3.** The simple modes of number are the most distinct of all
our ideas.
Every least variation—namely, of _one unit_ —makes
each combination as clearly different from its nearest neighbour as it is from the most remote: _two_ is as distinct from
_one_ as from _two hundred_ . . . .
This is not so with other simple
modes, where it can be hard and perhaps impossible for us
to distinguish between two nearby ideas even though they
are really different.
Who will undertake to find a difference
between the white of this paper and that of the next degree
·of whiteness· to it?
Who can form distinct ideas of every
difference in size, however small?


**4.** Demonstrations with numbers may not be more evident
and exact than demonstrations with extension, but they are
more •general in their use and more •determinate in their



application.
Or so I am inclined think, because each mode of
number is so clearly distinct from all others, even close ones,
whereas with extension not every equality and excess is so
easy to observe or measure.
With number we have the idea
of a _unit_, but with extension our thoughts can’t arrive at any
determined smallness beyond which it can’t go, comparable
with a unit. . . .
No-one can specify an angle that is the _next_
_biggest_ to a right angle!


**5.** By repeating the idea of a unit, joining it to another unit,
we make one collective idea marked by the name ‘two’.
If
someone can do this, and can carry the procedure further
by adding _one_ to each collective idea that he reaches, and
also gives a name to every number whose idea he comes
to, then he can _count_ . . . .
He can add one to one, and so
to two, and so go on with his tally, taking with him the
distinct names belonging to every ·stage in the· progression;
and so he is capable of all the ideas of numbers for which
he has names.
Perhaps not of ideas for which he doesn’t
have names; because the various simple modes of numbers
have no variety, and can’t differ from one another in any
way except as _more_ or _less_, so that names or marks for each
separate combination seem more necessary than with any
other sort of ideas.
For without such names or marks we
can seldom make use of numbers in calculating, especially
in cases involving a great multitude of units.
When such a
multitude is assembled ·in thought· without a name or mark
to distinguish that precise collection, it will hardly be kept
from collapsing into a confused heap.


**6.** I think this is why some Americans [= ‘American Indians’] with
whom I have spoken, though otherwise quick and intelligent,
didn’t have our ability to count to 1000, and had no distinct
idea of that number, though they could calculate very well up
to 20.
Their language was scanty, being accommodated only


to the few necessities of survival in a simple way of life that
didn’t involve either trade or mathematics; so it contained no
word to stand for 1000.
When I spoke to them about those
greater numbers, they would show the hairs of their head, to
express a great multitude that they couldn’t number. [After
giving another example, Locke speaks of the possibility of
our wanting to think about higher numbers than we usually
do, and thus needing names for them.
He proposes that as
well as ‘million’ we adopt ‘billion’, ‘trillion’, ‘quadrillion’ and
so on, up to ‘nonillion’—and further if we need to.
His billion
is a million millions.]


[In section **7** Locke discusses children, who, at a time when
they have a great deal of intellectual capacity, can’t count or
handle particular numbers in other ways; and some adults
who ‘through the default of their memories’ have a life-long
inability to cope with higher numbers.
He concludes:] To
calculate correctly, one must do two things: **1** distinguish
carefully two ideas that differ from one another only by
one unit; **2** retain in memory the names or marks of the
several combinations, from a unit up to that number—not
confusedly and at random, but in the exact order in which
the numbers follow one another.
If one goes wrong in _either_ of



these, the whole business of numbering will be disturbed, the
ideas necessary for distinct numeration won’t be achieved,
and one will be left only with the confused idea of _multitude_ .


**8.** Number is what the mind makes use of in measuring
things.
The main things that are measurable are expansion
and duration; and our idea of infinity, even when applied
to those—·in the ideas of •infinite expansion and •infinite
duration·—seems to be nothing but the infinity of _number_ .
What else are our ideas of •eternity and •immensity but
the repeated additions of certain ideas of imagined parts
of duration and expansion, with ·help from· the infinity
of number, in which we can come to no end of addition?
·Regarding that last point·: Let a man collect into one sum
as great a number as he pleases, its size doesn’t lessen even
slightly his power of adding to it, or bring him any nearer the
end of the inexhaustible stock of number, where there still
remains as much to be added as if none were taken out.
This
addition—or _addibility_, if you wish—of numbers which is so
apparent to the mind is, I think, what gives us our clearest
and most distinct idea of infinity.
More about that in the
next chapter.


# **Chapter xvii: Infinity**



**1.** If you want to know what kind of idea it is that we name
‘infinity’, you can’t do better than to consider •what the idea
of infinity is most immediately applied to by the mind, and
then •how the mind comes to form this idea.
_Finite_ and _infinite_ seem to me to be viewed by the mind as
modes of _quantity_, and to be attributed primarily and initially
only to things that have parts, and can be augmented or
diminished by the addition or subtraction of parts, however
small.
Such are the ideas of _space_, _duration_, and _number_,
which we have considered in xiii-xvi.
No doubt we must
accept that the great God is incomprehensibly infinite; but
when we apply ‘infinite’ to that first and supreme being, we
do it primarily in respect to _when_ and _where_ he exists, ·in
the judgment that he exists always and everywhere·; and
we apply infinity more figuratively (I think) to his power,
wisdom, and goodness, and other attributes, which are in
their own natures inexhaustible and incomprehensible, etc.
When we call them ‘infinite’ we have no other idea of this
infinity except what carries with it some reflection on, and
imitation of, that _number_ or _extent_ of the acts or objects of
God’s power, wisdom, and goodness.
I make no claim about
how these attributes are in God, who is infinitely beyond
the reach of our narrow capacities.
They certainly contain
in them all possible perfection.
But this, I say, is how we
conceive them, and these are our ideas of their infinity.


**2.** _Finite_ and _infinite_, then, are viewed by the mind as
modifications of expansion and duration.
Next we must
consider how the mind comes by these ideas.
There is
no great difficulty about _finite_ .
The obvious portions of
extension that affect our senses carry the idea of _finite_
with them into the mind; and the ordinary periods (hours,



days, years) whereby we measure time and duration are
bounded lengths, ·and thus _finite_ ·.
What is difficult is to
grasp how we come by those boundless ideas of eternity
and immensity, since the objects we interact with fall so far
short—immeasurably short—of that largeness.


**3.** Someone who has an idea of some stated length of space
finds that he can repeat it, going from the idea of one foot
(say) to that of two feet, and that by further addition he can
go to three feet, and so on without ever reaching an end of
his addition.
This holds good whether he started with the
idea of a foot, or of a mile, or of the diameter of the earth.
Whatever he starts with, and however often he multiplies it,
he finds that however far he has gone he has no more reason
to stop—and isn’t one jot nearer the end—than he was when
he set out.
From this he takes the idea of infinite space.


**4.** That account of the source of the idea of infinite space
doesn’t settle whether there actually exists a boundless space
answering to the idea, because our ideas aren’t always proofs
of the existence of things.
Still, since the question of space’s
infinity has come up here, I remark that we are apt to
think that space _is_ actually boundless; the idea of space
or expansion naturally draws us in that direction.
Whether
we consider it as the extension of body or as existing by itself
without any solid matter occupying it, the mind can’t possibly
find or suppose any end of it, or be stopped anywhere in
its progress in this space.
Any boundary to the world of
bodies—even one with diamond-hard walls—is so far from
_stopping_ the mind’s further progress in space and extension
that it actually _helps it to continue_ .
When we reach the
utmost extremity of body, what do we find that can put a


stop, and satisfy the mind that it _is_ at the end of space when
it perceives that it _is not_ —when, indeed, it is satisfied that
body itself can move into it [= into the space outside the present

material boundary]?
Here is why.
A body can move through
empty space within the world of bodies; indeed it can’t move
anywhere _except_ into empty space (·see xiii.22·).
It is clear
and evident that if a body can move into an empty space
interspersed amongst bodies, it must be equally possible for
it to move into empty space beyond the outer boundaries
of the world of bodies.
That is because idea of empty pure
space is exactly the same _within_ as _beyond_ the limits of all
bodies, and there is nothing to hinder body from moving into
it in either case.
Thus, wherever the mind places itself by
any thought, either in among bodies or far away from them,
it can’t find any _end_ anywhere in this uniform idea of space;
and so it has to conclude, by the very nature and idea of
each part of space, that space is actually infinite.


[Section **5** gives a similar account of how we ‘come by the idea
of eternity’ or infinite duration.
The question of whether any
real thing lasts for ever, Locke says, isn’t answered merely
by our having an idea of eternity.
He holds that if something
exists now, then something has existed for eternity, but
he will discuss this ‘in another place’ (IV.x.2–3). and won’t
discuss it here.]


**6.** If we get our idea of infinity from our ability to repeat
our own ideas without end, you may wonder why we don’t
attribute infinity to ideas other than those of space and
duration.
Other ideas can be as easily and as often repeated in our minds as can those of space and duration;
but nobody ever thinks of infinite sweetness, or infinite
whiteness, although we can repeat the idea of sweet or white
as frequently as those of a yard or a day.
Here is my answer.
All the ideas that are considered as having parts, and can be



increased by adding equal or lesser parts, give us through
their repetition the idea of infinity; because this endless
repetition generates a continued enlargement that cannot
come to an end.
But with other ideas it is not so. [Locke
defends this by canvassing the possibilities for what goes
on when one tries to add one idea of whiteness to another.
The reason why they don’t allow of endless additions, he
says, is that the idea of whiteness involves _degrees_ but not
_parts_ .
He concludes:] Those ideas that don’t consist of parts
can’t be augmented to whatever proportion men please, or
be stretched beyond what men have received by their senses;
but space, duration, and number, being capable of increase
by repetition, leave in the mind an idea of endless room for
more.
The latter ideas alone lead our minds towards the
thought of infinity.


**7.** Although our idea of infinity arises from thoughts about
quantity, when we join infinity to any supposed idea of
quantity, and so think about an _infinite quantity_ —an infinite
space, or an infinite duration—we fall into great confusion.
That is because our idea of infinity is an _endlessly growing_
idea, while any idea the mind has of a quantity _terminates_
in that very idea (which can’t be greater than itself); so when
we try to combine them in the thought of an infinite quantity
we have to adjust a standing measure to a growing volume.
So I think there is serious reason to distinguish the idea of

- _the infinity of space_ from the idea of • _a space that is infinite_ .
The former is nothing but •a supposed endless progression
of the mind over whatever repeated ideas of space it pleases;
but to have actually in the mind the idea of •a space that is
infinite is to suppose that the mind has already passed over
and actually viewed all those repeated ideas of space.
Even
an endless repetition can never go through them all; so to
suppose that one has done so is a plain contradiction.


**8.** This may become clearer if we apply it to numbers. [Locke
then presents a line of thought like that of section 7, leading
to the conclusion that we have a clear and legitimate idea of
the infinity of number(s) but that it is absurd to think that we
can have an ‘actual idea of an infinite number’.
He applies
this also to ‘infinite duration’, and repeats it for ‘infinite
space’.
A typical episode is this:] However large an idea of
space I have in my mind, it is no larger than it is at this
instant when I have it, though I am capable of doubling it an
instant later, and so on ad infinitum.


[In sections **9–11** Locke argues—amplifying a hint he gave
in xvi.8—that when we think about the infinity of space or of
duration, what we are engaged with is ‘the infinity of number
applied to determinate parts of which we have distinct ideas’.
Our thought of eternity is that of a duration that is _infinitely_
_many_ years long; our thought of ‘immensity’ is that of a
region whose volume is _infinitely many_ cubic yards.]


**12.** In any mass of matter our thoughts can never arrive
at the ultimate division, so there is an apparent infinity
to us in that also.
It too involves the infinity of number,
but with the difference that it is like division rather than
addition.
Still, it does involve proceeding ad infinitum, with
new numbers—·smaller and smaller fractions·—all the way.
A similarity: just as we can’t by addition reach the idea of
an infinitely great space, so by division we are unable to
reach the idea of an infinitely small body; because our idea
of infinity is (so to speak) a growing or fugitive idea, always
in a boundless progression, stopping nowhere.


**13.** Although hardly anyone is so absurd as to claim to
have the positive idea of an actual infinite number,. . . .there
are people who imagine they have positive ideas of infinite
duration and space.
I think it would be enough to destroy
any such ·purported· positive idea of something infinite to



ask its owner whether he could add to it; that would easily
show his mistake. . . .
An infinite idea of space or duration
must be made up of infinite parts; so ·the thought of· its
infinity must consist in ·the thought of· its having parts
•whose number can always be further added to; it doesn’t
involve •an actual positive idea of an infinite number.
It
is evident that by adding together finite things (and all the
lengths of which we have positive ideas _are_ finite) we can
never produce the idea of infinite in any way except the way
we do with number. . . .—adding more and more units of the
same kind, without coming one jot nearer to the end of the
process.


**14.** Those who want to prove that their idea of infinite
is positive seem to do it through a ridiculous argument:
the idea of an _end_ is negative, so the idea of infinity—the
_negation of an end_ —is positive!
Someone who sees that
where bodies are concerned an end is just the extremity
or surface of the body will not readily grant that the end
is a bare negative, any more than will someone who sees
that the _end_ of his pen is black or white!
Where duration is
concerned, an end isn’t •the bare negation of existence but
rather •the last moment of it.
Also, the people I am arguing
against here can’t deny that the _beginning_ is the first instant
of being, and isn’t conceived by anyone to be a bare negation;
so by their own argument they should admit that the idea
of an eternal past, or of a duration _without_ a beginning, is a
negative one.


[In section **15** Locke develops these views further.
He agrees
that when we think of (say) the infinity of space our thought
does include a positive element, namely the vague thought
of a really enormously large stretch of space; but he distinguishes that from a genuine thought about infinity.
His
crucial triple-point in this section is the following.] **1** The


idea of _so much_ is positive and clear. **2** The idea of _greater_
is also clear, but it is only a comparative idea. **3** The idea
of _so much greater that it cannot be comprehended_ is a plain
negative, not a positive. [A little later:] What lies beyond our
positive idea towards infinity lies in obscurity, and has the
indeterminate confusion of

a negative idea in which I know that I can’t include
all that I want to, because that is too large for a finite
and narrow ·mental· capacity ·such as mine·;
and that—where the greatest part of what I want to include is
left out, and merely given the vague label ‘still greater’—must
be very far from a positive complete idea. . . .


[In section **16** Locke challenges those who think they have a
positive idea of eternity.
If there is or could be an eternally
existing thing, he demands, has it lasted longer today than
it had yesterday?
The answer Yes strikes him as absurd
because it involves different eternities, with different lengths.
But the only way to support the answer No is to equate
eternal duration with a kind of eternal _present_, to which
the idea of succession, of longer and shorter durations,
doesn’t apply.
He aligns himself with those who find this
unintelligible.]


[Section **17** repeats section **14** ’s point that there is nothing
negative about the concept of a _beginning_ .]


**18.** We can no more have a positive idea of the largest space
than we can of the smallest space.
The latter seems the easier
of the two, and more within our intellectual reach, but really
all we can manage is a comparative idea of smallness—the
idea of a smallness that _will always be less than any of_
_which we have a positive idea_ .
All our •positive ideas of any
quantity, whether big or small, have bounds; though there
are no bounds to the •comparative idea through which we
can always add to the big or take from the small. [Locke



has mostly been using ‘positive’ as the opposite of ‘negative’; but here


and in some other places he uses it as the opposite of ‘relational’ or

‘comparative’.] But the part (big or small) that isn’t covered
by our positive idea lies in obscurity; and we have no idea
of it except the idea of the power of endlessly enlarging
one and diminishing the other.
The acutest thought of a
mathematician can no more isolate ·the idea of· an indivisible
ultimate particle of matter than a chemist wielding a pestle
and mortar can ·physically· isolate such a particle.
And
a philosopher by the quickest flight of mind can no more
reach ·a thought of· infinite space, containing it within a
positive idea, than a surveyor can mark it out with his
chain measure.
When you think of a cube with a one-inch
side, you have a clear and positive idea of it in your mind,
and so can form one of ½, ¼, and so on, until you have
the idea something very small.
But it still isn’t the idea of
that incomprehensible smallness that division _can_ produce.
What remains of smallness [Locke’s phrase] is as far from your
thoughts as it was when you first began; so you never come
to have a clear and positive idea of that smallness that is
implied by infinite divisibility.


[Section **19** repeats the main point in a mildly joking manner.]


**20.** I have encountered people who agree that they cannot
have a positive idea of •infinite space, but are sure they have
one of •eternity.
Here is my explanation for their mistaken
view that the two should be treated differently.
By thinking
about causes and effects, they are led to think that we must
admit some _eternal being_, and so to consider the reality of
that being as matched by their idea of eternity; but on the
other hand they have no argument driving them to admit
the existence of some _infinite body_, which indeed they find
absurd; and so they rush into •concluding that they can


have no idea of infinite space because they can have no idea
of infinite matter. [The argument about causes and effects and an

eternal being is approvingly presented in IV.x.2–3.] This •inference is
a poor affair, because the existence of matter isn’t necessary
to the existence of space any more than the existence of
motion or of the sun is necessary to duration, although
duration is commonly measured by motion of the sun.
A man
can have the idea of ten thousand miles square without any
body as big as that, as well as the idea of ten thousand years
without any body as old as that. . . .
Why should we think
our idea of infinite space requires the real existence of matter
to support it, when we find that we have as clear an idea of
an •infinite duration to come as we have of •infinite duration
past? [In the remainder of this section Locke expands these
points somewhat, concluding thus:] If a man had a positive
idea of infinity, whether of duration or of space, he could add
two infinites together, making one infinite infinitely bigger
than another—an absurdity too gross to be worth arguing
against.


**21.** If after all this you still think you _do_ have clear positive
comprehensive ideas of infinity, enjoy your privilege!
Some
of us who _don’t_ would like to hear from you about it.
Until
now I have been apt to think that the great and inextricable
difficulties that perpetually arise in all discussions about
infinity, whether of space, duration, or divisibility, have been



sure signs of a defect in our ideas of infinity—namely the
disproportion between •infinity itself and •how much our
narrow minds can take in.
Men talk and dispute about
infinite space or duration, as if they had complete and
positive ideas of them;. . . .but the incomprehensible nature
of the thing they are talking or thinking about leads them
into perplexities and contradictions; and their minds are
swamped by an object too large and mighty to be surveyed
and managed by them.


**22.** If I have lingered rather long on duration, space, and
number, and on what arises from thinking about them,
namely infinity, it may be no more than the topic requires, for
there are few simple ideas whose modes give more exercise
to the thoughts of men than those do.
I don’t claim to have
treated them in their full extent; all I need is to show how the
mind receives those ideas, such as they are, from •sensation
and •reflection, and how even our idea of infinity—remote as
it seems to be from any •object of sense or •operation of our
mind—originates in sensation and reflection as do all our
other ideas.
Perhaps some very advanced mathematicians
have other ways to introduce ideas of infinity into their
minds; but this doesn’t alter the fact that even they, like all
other men, first acquired their ideas of infinity from sensation
and reflection in the manner I have described.


# **Chapter xviii: Other simple modes**



**1.** Perhaps I have given enough examples of _simple modes_
of the _simple ideas of sensation_, going so far as to show how
from simple ideas taken in by sensation the mind comes
to extend itself even to infinity. . . .
Still, for method’s sake
I shall briefly describe a few more ·simple modes· before
moving on to ideas that are more complex. ·Remember that
in my classificatory system _simple modes_ are _complex ideas_,
though they are _less_ complex than _complex modes_ are·


**2.** To ‘slide’, ‘roll’, ‘tumble’, ‘walk’, ‘creep’, ‘run’, ‘dance’, ‘leap’,
‘skip’, and many others that might be named, are words
for which every English-speaker has in his mind distinct
ideas, which are all modifications of _motion_ .
Modes of motion
correspond to those of extension: _swift_ and _slow_ are two
different ideas of motion, measured by distances of time and
space put together; so they are complex ideas comprehending
time and space with motion.


**3.** We have a similar variety with _sounds_ .
Every articulate
word is a different modification of sound; and from hearing
such modifications the mind can be provided with almost
infinitely many distinct ideas. [Locke also mentions the
sounds of birds and beasts, and the auditory ideas that a
composer may have in his mind when silently composing a
tune.]


**4.** Ideas of colours are also very various.
We pick out some
of them as the different degrees or ‘shades’ (as they are
called) of the same colour.
But since we very seldom put
different _colours_ together for use or for pleasure without also
giving a role to _shape_ —as in painting, weaving, needle-work,
etc.—the colours that we pick out for attention usually belong
to mixed modes, as being made up of ideas of two kinds,



shape and colour, as for example _beauty_, _rainbow_, etc.


**5.** All compounded tastes and smells are also modes made
up of the simple ideas of those senses.
But because we
seldom have names for them, we take less notice of them,
and they can’t be explained in writing. you’ll have to think
up your own examples from your own experience.


**6.** Here is a point about simple modes that are considered
to be merely different degrees of the same simple idea, ·e.g.
slightly different shades of green·.
Though many of them
are in themselves entirely distinct ideas, when the difference
between them is very small they ordinarily don’t have separate names, and the differences are not much taken notice
of.
I leave it to you to think about whether this is •because
men haven’t had ways of precisely distinguishing amongst
them, or rather •because distinguishing them wouldn’t yield
knowledge that would be of general or necessary use. . . .
Once the mind has acquired some simple ideas, it can
variously repeat and compound them, and so make new
complex ideas. ·This actually happens with some of our
simple ideas and not with others·.
Though _white_, _red_, _sweet_,
etc. haven’t been modified or made into complex ideas by
various combinations so as to be named and thereby sorted
into kinds, some other simple ideas, namely those of _unity_,
_duration_, _motion_, etc. (already discussed) and also _power_
and _thinking_ (·to be discussed in xxi and xix respectively·),
have been modified into a great variety of complex ideas with
names belonging to them.


[In section **7** Locke offers to explain this.
The primary
concerns of people have been with _one another_ ; they have
mainly needed efficient ways of thinking and talking about


their own behaviour—including the actions performed in
specialized trades, for which technical terms are coined that
the rest of the populace wouldn’t understand.
Ideas such



as those of tastes and smells haven’t had a great role in
this kind of thought and speech, which is why we have few
names for them.
Locke undertakes to return to this in III.]


# **Chapter xix: The modes of thinking**



**1.** When the mind looks in on itself and attends to its
own actions, _thinking_ is the first action it encounters.
The
mind observes a great variety of kinds of thinking, receiving
different ideas from each.
For example, the perception that
accompanies and is attached to any impression made on
the body by an external object gives the mind a distinct
idea that we call _sensation_, which is, as it were, the actual
entrance of any idea into the understanding by way of the
senses.
The same idea, when it occurs without the operation
of any such object on the organs of sense, is _remembrance_ ;
if it is sought by the mind and eventually, with considerable
effort and difficulty, brought back into view, it is _recollection_ .

[The section continues with some others: contemplation,
‘that which the French call _rêverie_ ’, attention, ‘intention, or
study’, dreaming, ecstasy.
Here and in section 4 Locke uses
‘intention’ in its old sense of ‘intentness’ or ‘strenuous mental
focus’.]


**2.** These are a few examples of the various modes of thinking
that the mind can observe in itself, and so have distinct ideas
of.
I don’t claim to enumerate them all, or to give an extensive
treatment of this set of ideas that are acquired from reflection,
for that would fill a book.
However, I shall later treat at some
length _reasoning_, _judging_, _volition_, and _knowledge_, which



are some of the most considerable operations of the mind
and ways of thinking.


[Section **3** adds some detail about differences amongst attention, _rêverie_, and dreaming.
It ends with this:] Sometimes
the mind fixes itself so earnestly on thinking about some
objects. . . .that it shuts out all other thoughts, and takes
no notice of the ordinary impressions that are then being
made on the senses. . . .
At other times it hardly notices the
sequence of ideas that succeed in the understanding, and
doesn’t pursue any of them.
And at other times it lets them
pass almost entirely unregarded, as faint shadows that make
no impression.


**4.** I think everyone must have experienced within himself
this difference in degree of •intention (and of its opposite,
•remission) on a scale running from • _earnest study_ at one
end to • _very nearly minding nothing at all_ at the other.
Go
down the scale a little further still and you find the mind
in sleep—withdrawn from the senses, and out of the reach
of motions made on the sense-organs that at other times
produce very vivid and perceptible ideas. . . .
In this state
of withdrawal from the senses, the mind often retains a
looser and less coherent manner of thinking that we call
_dreaming_ .
Finally, sound sleep lowers the curtain in front


of the stage, putting an end to all appearances. . . .
A side
remark, ·returning briefly to the main topic of i.10–22·: We all
have experience of our minds’ thinking with various degrees
of intensity; even a waking man may have thoughts that are
so dim and obscure as to be close to having none at all; so



isn’t it probable that thinking is something the soul _does_
but is not its _essence_ ?
A thing’s •operations can easily be
performed more or less intensely, but we don’t think of the
•essences of things as capable of any such variation.


# **Chapter xx: Modes of pleasure and pain**



**1.** Among the simple ideas that we receive from both
sensation and reflection, _pain_ and _pleasure_ are two very
considerable ones. •Bodily sensations may occur alone
or accompanied by pain or pleasure; and •the thoughts
or perceptions of the mind may also occur solo or else
accompanied by pleasure or pain, delight or trouble, call
it what you will.
Like other simple ideas, these two can’t be
described, nor can their names be defined; the only way to
know them is by experience.
A ‘definition’ of them in terms
of the presence of good or evil makes them known to us only
by making us reflect on _what we feel in ourselves_ when we
think about or undergo various operations of good and evil.


**2.** Things, then, are good or bad only in reference to pleasure
or pain. [Locke wrote ‘good or evil’, but in his usage ‘evil’ means merely


‘bad’, without the extra force the word has today.
When used as a noun,


as in ‘presence of evil’, it is left unchanged because ‘bad’ doesn’t work

well as a noun.] ·So that the attempt to define ‘pleasure’ and
‘pain’ in terms of good and evil puts things back to front·.
We
call something ‘good’ if it is apt to cause or increase pleasure
or diminish pain in us, or else to enable us to get or retain
some other good.
On the other side, we call something ‘bad’



if it is apt to produce or increase pain or diminish pleasure
in us or. . . .[etc.] I am speaking of pleasure and pain of body
or of mind, as they are commonly distinguished, though
really they are all states of the mind—sometimes caused by
disorder in the body and sometimes by thoughts of the mind.


**3.** Pleasure and pain and that which causes them, good and
evil, are the hinges on which our passions turn.
If we reflect
on ourselves, and observe how these operate in us in various
contexts, what states of mind and internal sensations (if I
may so call them) they produce in us, this may lead us to
form the ideas of our _passions_ .


**4.** Anyone reflecting on the thought he has of the delight
that any present or absent thing is apt to produce in him has
the idea we call _love_ . [Locke gives the example of someone
who—in season and out—loves grapes.]


**5.** On the other side, the thought of the pain that anything
present or absent is apt to produce in us is what we call
_hatred_ .
If my theme were not confined to the bare _ideas_
_of_ our passions in their dependence on different kinds of
pleasure and pain, I would remark that our love and hatred
of •inanimate or unfeeling things is commonly founded on the


pleasure and pain we get from using them and encountering
them through our senses, even if such use destroys them.
But hatred or love towards •beings who are capable of happiness or misery is often the uneasiness or delight that we get
just from the thought that they exist, or from the thought of
their being happy. . . .
But it suffices to note that our ideas of
love and hatred are merely ·ideas of· the dispositions of the
mind to experience pleasure or pain, however caused in us.


**6.** A man’s uneasiness over the absence of something whose
present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it is what
we call _desire_ ; which is greater or less according to whether
the uneasiness is more or less intense. [Locke adds some
remarks about uneasiness as ‘the chief if not only spur to
human industry and action’.
He admits that this is off his
intended path; he’ll deal with it at length in xxi.29–40.]


**7.** _Jo_ y is a delight of the mind from the thought of a good
that one now possesses or will certainly possess in the future.
We are possessed of a good when we have it in our power so
that we can use it when we please.
Thus a nearly starving
man has joy at the arrival of food, even before he has the
pleasure of eating it. . . .


**8.** _Sorrow_ is uneasiness in the mind upon the thought of a
lost good that might have been enjoyed longer; or the sense
of a present evil.


**9.** _Hope_ is that pleasure in the mind that everyone finds in
himself when he thinks about a probable future enjoyment
of something that is apt to delight him.


**10.** _Fear_ is an uneasiness of the mind from the thought of
future evil that is likely to come to us.


**11.** _Despair_ is the thought that some good is unattainable.
This works variously in men’s minds, sometimes producing
uneasiness or pain, sometimes slack passivity.



**12.** _Anger_ is uneasiness or discomposure of the mind when
one is harmed and intends to get revenge for this.


**13.** _Envy_ is an uneasiness of the mind caused by the thought
of a good that we desire that has been obtained by someone
we think should not have had it before us.


**14.** These two last, envy and anger, are not caused simply
by pain and pleasure, but have other ingredients in them—
thoughts regarding oneself or others—which is why they
aren’t to be found in all men, because some men don’t have
those thoughts of their own merits (envy) or of intending
revenge (anger).
All the rest, which come down to purely
pain and pleasure, are I think to be found in all men.
For
basically we •love, desire, rejoice, and hope only in respect of
pleasure, and •hate, fear, and grieve only in respect of pain.
In short, all these passions are moved by things only when
they appear to be causes of pleasure and pain, or to be in
some way associated with pleasure or pain.
Thus we extend
our hatred usually to the subject (at least if it is an agent
that has perceptions and purposes) which has given us pain,
because the fear it leaves with us is a constant pain.
But
we don’t so constantly love what has done us good, because
pleasure doesn’t operate on us as strongly as pain does, and
because we aren’t as apt to •hope that a good-doer will bring
pleasure again as we are to •fear that a bad-doer will bring
pain again.
But this is by the way.


[In section **15** Locke repeats that he means ‘pleasure’ and
‘pain’, ‘delight’ and ‘uneasiness’, to cover mental as well as
bodily ups and downs.]


**16.** It should further be noted that so far as the passions
are concerned, the removal or lessening of a pain is considered as a pleasure and operates as such; and the loss or
diminishing of a pleasure, as a pain.


**17.** Most of the passions in most persons operate on the
body, causing various changes in it; but as these aren’t
always perceptible, ·and indeed in some cases don’t occur
at all·, they don’t make a necessary part of the idea of each
passion.
For example, _shame_, which is an uneasiness of
the mind on the thought of having done something that is
indecent or will lessen others’ valued esteem for us, isn’t
always accompanied by blushing.


**18.** Don’t take me to be offering a treatise on the passions.
There are many more of them than I have named; and
each of those I have attended to merits a much fuller and
more detailed treatment.
I have mentioned these only as so



many instances of _modes of pleasure and pain_ resulting in
our minds from various considerations of good and evil.
I
might perhaps have given instances that are simpler than
these ·and don’t count as passions·, such as the pains of
hunger and thirst and the pleasure of eating and drinking
to remove them; the pain of sore eyes, and the pleasure of
music; the pain of quarrelsome uninstructive argument, and
the pleasure of reasonable conversation with a friend.
But
the passions are more important to us ·than the simpler
pleasures and pains·, which is why I chose to focus on them
and to show how our ideas of them come from sensation or
reflection.


# **Chapter xxi: Power**



**1.** The mind being every day informed by the senses of the
alteration of the simple ideas [here = ‘qualities’] that it observes
in things outside it, and

•noticing how one comes to an end and another begins
to exist,
•reflecting also on what passes within itself, and observing a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by
the impression of outer objects on the senses and
sometimes by its own choice; and
•concluding from what it has so constantly observed to
have happened that similar changes will in the future
be made in the same things by similar agents and in
similar ways,
•considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its
simple ideas changed, and in another the possibility of
making that change, and •so comes by that idea that we
call _power_ .
Thus we say that fire has a power to melt gold,
and gold has a power to be melted. . . .; that the sun has a
power to blanch wax, and wax a power to be blanched by
the sun. . . .
In all such cases the power we think of is in
reference to the change of perceivable ideas, for we can’t
observe or conceive any alteration to be made in a thing
except by observing or conceiving a change of some of its
ideas.


**2.** Power is twofold—the ability to make a change, and the
ability to be changed; one may be called _active_, the other
_passive_ power. [In Locke’s usage, ‘power’ doesn’t mean ‘strength’; our


nearest word to it is ‘ability’ or ‘capability’; sugar’s (passive) _power_ to be

dissolved in hot water is simply its _being able_ to be thus dissolved.] God
is entirely above passive power; and perhaps matter lacks all
active power, so that only _created minds_ have powers of both



sorts; but I shan’t go into that question.
My present business
isn’t to enquire into what things have power, but rather to
explore how we come by the _idea_ of it.
Still, I thought it
worthwhile to make the foregoing remarks, directing our
minds to the thought of _God_ and _minds_ for the clearest idea
of active powers ·because otherwise that might have been
lost sight of in what follows·.
We shall see that active powers
loom large in our complex ideas of _natural substances_, and
I shall speak of such substances as having active powers,
following common assumptions about them, even though
they may not be such genuinely active powers as our casual
thoughts are apt to represent them.
That is why I have
thought it worthwhile to direct our mind to God and spirits
for the clearest idea of _active power_ .


**3.** ·In xii.3 I announced that the three great categories
of complex ideas are those of •modes, •substances, and
•relations.
We are still not finished with •modes.
And yet·:
I admit that _power_ includes in it some kind of •relation—to
action or to change—but then _all_ our ideas turn out on close
inspection to involve a relational element. ideas of extension,
duration, and number all contain a secret _relation_ of the
parts.
Shape and motion have something _relative_ in them,
much more obviously.
As for sensible qualities such as
colours and smells etc.—what are they but the powers of
different bodies in _relation_ to our perception?
As for their
basis in the things themselves, they depend on the volume,
shape, texture, and motion of the parts, all of which include
some kind of _relation_ in them.
So our idea of power, I think,
·being no more relational than any of the others·, is entitled
to a place among the simple ideas, and be considered as
one of them, being one of the ideas that make a principal


ingredient in our complex idea of substances, as we shall see
later. [Locke should have said ‘a place among the simple _modes_ ’, which

he has classified as complex ideas—see xii.5.]


**4.** We are abundantly provided with the idea of passive power
by almost all sorts of perceptible things.
In most of them
we can’t help noticing that there are continual changes in
their sensible qualities, and indeed a continual turn-over
in the stuff they are made of; and from this we reasonably
infer that they go on being liable to similar changes ·which
is to attribute to them a •passive power to be thus changed·.
We are at least as richly provided with examples of •active
power (which is the more proper meaning of the word ‘power’),
because whatever change we observe, the mind must infer
·an active· power somewhere to make that change, as well
as ·a passive power·, a possibility in the thing to undergo
the change.
But if we think about it hard we’ll see that
bodies don’t give us through our senses as clear and distinct
an idea of active power as we get from reflecting on the
operations of our minds.
All power relates to action, and
there are just two sorts of action of which we have any
idea, namely •thinking and •motion.
So let us consider from
where we get our clearest ideas of the powers that produce
these actions. **1** Body gives us no idea of _thinking_ ; it is only
from reflection that we have that. **2** Neither does body give
us any idea of _the beginning of motion_ .
A motionless body
doesn’t give us any idea of any active power to move; and
when a body is put in motion, that motion is a •passion
in it rather than an •action [= ‘something with respect to which

it is •passive rather than •active’].
For when the ball obeys the
motion of a billiard cue, that isn’t any action on its part but
mere passion; and when it hits another ball and sets it in
motion, it only communicates the motion it had received from
something else and loses in itself so much as the second ball



received.
This gives us only a very obscure idea of an _active_
_power of moving_ in body, because all we see the body do is
to _transfer_ motion, not to _produce it_ .
For it is a very obscure
idea of _power_ that doesn’t stretch as far as •the production
of an action, and merely takes in •the continuation of a
passion.
That’s all that is involved in the movement of a
body that is put into motion: its _continuing to move_ after it
has been set in motion is no more an action on its part than
is its _continuing to be flat_ after something has flattened it.
The idea of the beginning of motion is one that we get only
from reflection on what happens in ourselves, where we find
by experience that merely by willing something—merely by
a thought of the mind—we can move parts of our bodies
that have been at rest.
So it seems to me that our sensory
perception of the operations of bodies gives us only a very
imperfect and obscure idea of active power, since it provides
no idea of the power to begin any action, whether physical or
mental.
If you think you have a clear idea of power from your
observations of colliding bodies, I shan’t quarrel with you,
because sensation is one of the ways by which the mind gets
its ideas.
But I thought it worthwhile to consider—just in
passing—whether the mind doesn’t receive its idea of active
power more clearly from reflection on its own operations
than from any external sensation.


**5.** This at least seems to me evident:- We find in ourselves a
power to begin or not begin, and to continue or end, various
actions of our minds and motions of our bodies, by a mere
thought or preference of the mind in which it commands (so
to speak) that such and such an action be done or that it not
be done.
This power that the mind has to order that a given
idea be thought about or that it not be thought about, or to
prefer that a given part of the body move rather than stay still
(or vice versa), is what we call _the will_ .
The actual exercise


of that power in a particular case is what we call _volition_ or
_willing_ .
If your doing x (or not doing y) results from such an
order or command of the mind, your doing x (or not doing y)
is called _voluntary_ .
And any action that is performed without
such a thought of the mind is called _involuntary_ .
The power
of perception is what we call _the understanding_ .
Perception,
which is the act of the understanding, is of three sorts: **1**
the perception of ideas in our minds; **2** the perception of
the meanings of signs; **3** the perception of the connection
or inconsistency, agreement or disagreement, that there is
between any ·two· of our ideas.
All these are attributed to
the understanding, or perceptive power, though in ordinary
parlance we are said to ‘understand’ only with the latter two,
not with the mere perception of ideas in our minds.


**6.** These _powers_ of the mind, namely of perceiving and of
preferring, are usually called two _faculties_ of the mind.
The
word ‘faculty’ is proper enough as long as it isn’t allowed
to breed confusion in men’s thoughts by being taken to
stand for some real beings—·some _things_ ·—in the soul that
perform those actions of understanding and volition.
For
when we say


the will is the commanding and superior faculty of the
soul,
the will is (or is not) free,
the will determines the inferior faculties,
the will follows the dictates of the understanding,

and so on, statements like these can carry a clear and
distinct sense, for anyone who attends carefully to his own
ideas, and whose thoughts follow the evidence of things
rather than the sound of words.
But I suspect that this talk
about ‘faculties’ has misled many into a confused notion of
active _things_ in us,. . . .and that this has led to wrangling,
obscurity, and uncertainty in questions relating to them.



**7.** Everyone, I think, finds in himself a power to begin or not
begin, continue or put an end to, various actions in himself.
From thoughts of the _extent_ of this power of the mind over
the actions of the man the ideas of liberty and necessity arise.
·These two ideas have been at the heart of an enormous
amount of philosophical wrangling, encouraged by much
confusion.
I shall try to sort all that out in the next twenty
sections.
In section 28 I shall turn to other topics, though
freedom will return to the spotlight in sections 47–56·.


**8.** A man is _free_ to the extent that he has the power to
think or not, to move or not, according to the preference or
direction of his own mind. (The only •actions of which we
have any idea boil down to •thinking and •moving, which is
why I mention only them.) Whenever it is not equally in a
man’s power to do something x or not to do it—i.e. whenever
doing it is _not_ the case that

•if the preference of his mind directs him to do x, he
will do x, and
•if the preference of his mind directs him not to do x,
he won’t do x,
he isn’t free, isn’t at liberty, is under necessity.
Thus, there
can’t be liberty where there is no thought, no volition, no
will; but there may be thought, will, volition, where there is
no liberty.
Some examples make this clear.


**9.** Nobody thinks that a tennis-ball, whether moving because
it has been hit or lying still on the ground, is a free agent.
Why?
Because we don’t think of a tennis-ball as thinking or
(therefore) as having any volition, any preference of motion to
rest or vice versa.
Lacking volition, the ball comes under our
idea of _necessary_, and that is how we describe it.
Another
example: a man is crossing a bridge when it collapses,
pitching him into the river below; he doesn’t have liberty in
this, and isn’t a free agent.
He does have _volition,_ and _prefers_


his not falling to his falling, but not-falling isn’t within his
power and so doesn’t follow from his volition; and therefore
in this matter he isn’t free.
A third example: a man strikes
himself or a friend through a convulsive movement of his
arm that it isn’t in his power—by volition or the direction of
his mind—to stop or refrain from; and nobody thinks he has
liberty in this; everyone sympathizes with him, as acting by
necessity and constraint.


**10.** ·A fourth example·: a man is carried while fast asleep
into a room where there is a person he has been longing
to see and speak with; and he is there locked in securely;
when he awakes he is glad to find himself in such desirable
company, which he stays in willingly, preferring his staying
to his going away.
Nobody will doubt, I think, that his staying
is _voluntary_ ; and yet it is clear that being locked in he isn’t
_at liberty not to stay_ .
So liberty is not an idea belonging to
•volition or preferring [Locke’s exact words], but to •the person’s
having the power of doing or not doing something, according
to what his mind chooses or directs. idea of liberty reaches
as far as _that_ power and no further.
The moment that power
is restrained, or some compulsion removes one’s ability to
act or refrain from acting, liberty is extinguished.


**11.** We have examples of this—sometimes too many!—in our
own bodies.
A man’s heart beats, and the blood circulates,
and it isn’t in his power by any thought or volition to stop
either process; and therefore in respect to these motions he
isn’t a free agent.
Convulsive motions agitate his legs, so that
although he wills it ever so much he can’t by any power of
his mind stop their motion (as in that strange disease called
St.
Vitus’s dance) but he is perpetually dancing; he isn’t
at liberty in this action—he _has to_ move, just as does as a
tennis-ball struck with a racket.
On the other side, paralysis
or the stocks prevent his legs from obeying the decision of



his mind when it prefers that they take his body elsewhere.
In all these there is a _lack of freedom_ ; though the sitting still
even of a paralytic, while he prefers it to a removal, is truly
_voluntary_ .
Voluntary then is not opposed to necessary, but
to involuntary.
For a man may prefer what he can do to what
he can’t do; he may prefer the state he is in to its absence or
change, even though necessity makes it unalterable.


**12.** As with the motions of the body, so with the thoughts of
our minds: where any thought is such that we have power
to take it up or set it aside according to the preference of
the mind, there we are at liberty.
A waking man being
under the necessity of having some ideas constantly in his
mind, is not at liberty _to think or not think_, any more than
he is at liberty _to touch other bodies or not_ —·given that he
touches the ground he stands on·.
But whether he turns
his thoughts from one idea to another is often within his
choice; and then he is as much at liberty in respect of his
ideas as he is in respect of bodies he stands on; in each case
he can move from one to another as he pleases.
Still, just
as some bodily movements are unavoidable, so some ideas
are unavoidable by the mind, which can’t drive them away
by the utmost effort it can use.
A man on the rack isn’t
at liberty to set aside the idea of pain and distract himself
with other thoughts; and sometimes a boisterous passion
hurries our thoughts along as a hurricane does our bodies,
without leaving us free to think about other things that we
would rather choose.
But we consider the man as a free
agent again as soon as •his mind regains the power to stop
or continue, begin or not begin, any of these thoughts or
bodily movements according as •it thinks fit to prefer either
to the other.


**13.** _Necessity_ occurs where thought is lacking, and where
thought is present but doesn’t have the power to direct


the behaviour.
If an agent ·has thought and· is capable of
volition, but •starts or continues some action that is contrary
to the preference of his mind, that is called _compulsion_ ; if
he •stops or restricts an action when this is contrary to his
volition, this is called _restraint_ .


**14.** If I am right about all this, consider whether it might
help to put an end to the question _Is man’s will free or not?_
This has been long agitated, but I think it is unreasonable
because unintelligible.
It follows from what I have said that
the question itself is as improper and meaningless as _Is_
_man’s sleep swift or not?_ and _Is man’s virtue square or not?_
because liberty no more applies to the will than speed does
to sleep or squareness to virtue.
Liberty, which is a power,
belongs only to _agents_, and cannot be an attribute of the
will, which is only another _power_ .


**15.** It is so difficult to convey in words clear notions of
internal actions that I must warn you that my words ‘ordering’, ‘directing’, ‘choosing’, ‘preferring’, etc. will not distinctly
enough tell you what volition is unless you reflect on what
you yourself do when you will.
For example, ‘preferring’,
though it seems perhaps best to express the act of volition,
doesn’t do it precisely.
A man would _prefer_ flying to walking,
yet who can say he ever _wills_ himself to fly?
Clearly, volition
is an act of the mind knowingly exerting that control _it takes_
_itself to have_ over any part of the man, ·so that we can’t will
ourselves to fly because we know that we can’t do so·. [The
rest of this section repeats material from preceding sections.]


**16.** Plainly the will is simply one power or ability, and
freedom is another; so that to ask whether the will has
freedom is to ask whether one power has another power,
whether one ability has another ability—a question too
obviously and grossly absurd to argue about or to need
an answer.
For anyone can see that powers belong only to



•agents, and are attributes only of •substances, and not
of powers themselves!
So that the question ‘Is the will
free?’ contains the question ‘Is the will a substance, an
agent?’, since freedom can properly be attributed only to
acting substances.
If freedom can with any propriety of
speech be applied to ·any· power, it is to the power a has
man to affect movements of parts of his body by his choice
or preference.
But his having _that_ power is what entitles
him to be called ‘free’; indeed, that power _is_ freedom.
So now
we have the question ‘Is freedom free?’, and if anyone asked
_that_, we would conclude that he didn’t know what he was
talking about.
It would be like someone who, knowing that
‘rich’ was a word to express the possession of riches, asks
‘Are riches rich?’—making himself a candidate for Midas’s
ears!


**17.** But the absurdity is somewhat disguised—its meaning
somewhat hidden—when men speak of the will as a ‘faculty’
·and slip into thinking of it as an active substance rather
than as a power, which is what it really is·.
As soon as it is
made clear that the will is merely the power to do something,
the absurdity of saying that it is or isn’t free plainly reveals
itself.
If it were reasonable to think and talk of faculties as
distinct beings that can act (‘The will orders’, ‘The will is
free’), it would also be all right to have a speaking faculty,
a walking faculty, and a dancing faculty, and to think and
talk of these as producing the relevant actions—‘The singing
faculty sings’, ‘The dancing faculty dances’.
And when we
say such things as that •the will directs the understanding,
or •the understanding obeys or disobeys the will, this is no
more correct and intelligible than to say that the power of
speaking directs the power of singing, or the power of singing
obeys or disobeys the power of speaking.


[Section **18** continues that last point, criticising the state

ment that ‘the understanding operates on the will, or the will
on the understanding’, as though a power could operate on
a power.]


**19.** I grant that this or that •thought may be the occasion
of a •volition, that is, of a man’s exercising the power he
has to choose; and that the •choice of the mind may cause
the man’s •thinking about this or that thing. (Similarly, the
singing of a tune may cause the dancing of a dance, or vice
versa.) But in all these cases it isn’t one power that operates
on another.
Rather, the mind operates and exerts these
powers; it is the man that does the action, it is the agent that
has power or ability.
For powers are _relations_, not _agents_ ;
and the only thing that can be free or not free is •that which
_has_ or _lacks_ the power to operate, not •the power itself. . . .


[Section **20** continues with the theme of the misuse of the
notion of a faculty.
Of course the mind and the body have
faculties, because that is to have powers; and they couldn’t
operate if they had no power to operate.
The trouble comes
when faculties are treated as things, agents, rather than as
powers; and Locke provides examples.]


**21.** To return now to the enquiry about liberty, I think
the proper question is not _Is the will free?_ but _Is a man_
_free?_ ·There are two ways of taking the former question; I
shall deal with one in the remainder of this section, and the
other in sections 22–4·. [Locke then repeats the position he
has already laid out: that freedom consists in the ability to
act in the manner one’s mind chooses. ‘How can we think
anyone freer than to have the power to do what he will?’ He
concludes:] So that in respect of actions within the reach of
such a power in him, a man seems as free as it is possible
for freedom to make him.


**22.** But the inquisitive mind of men who want to clear
themselves of guilt as far as they can, even if that involves



putting themselves into a worse state than that of total
necessity, is not content with this notion of freedom.
For
their purposes freedom isn’t useful unless it goes further
than this.
And so we find people arguing that a man isn’t free
at all unless he is as _free to will_ as he is _free to do what he_
_wills_ .
So a further question about liberty is raised, namely
_Is a man free to will?_ Arguments about whether the will is
free are, I think, really about this.
Here is my answer to it.


[In sections **23–4** Locke presents one basic point: If at some
time you have in your mind the question of whether to
start walking right now, and you do have the power to start
walking and also the power not to do so, you _cannot be free_
with respect to the relevant act of volition.
Either you will
start walking or you won’t; whichever it is will be an upshot
of your choosing to walk or choosing not to; so you _cannot_
_get out of_ making an act of the will settling the matter; and
so your act of the will is not free.
In such a case, whatever
you do will be ‘unavoidably voluntary’.]


**25.** Plainly, then, a man is hardly ever at liberty whether
to will or not to will.
But a new question arises: _Is a man_
_at liberty to will which of the two he pleases, motion or rest_ ?
This question is so obviously absurd that it might suffice to
convince people that the question of freedom shouldn’t be
asked about the will.
To ask whether a man is at liberty to
will either motion or rest, speaking or silence, whichever he
pleases, is to ask, whether a man can will what he wills, or be
pleased with what he is pleased with.
This needs no answer,
I think; and those who insist on asking it must suppose that
one act of will arises from another, which arises from yet
another, and so on ad infinitum.


**26.** The best way to avoid such absurdities is to establish in
our minds definite ideas of the things we are talking about.
If the ideas of _liberty_ and _volition_ were well fixed in our


understandings, and if we kept them in our minds through
all the questions that are raised about liberty and volition, it
would be easier (I think) to resolve most of the difficulties that
perplex men’s thoughts and entangle their understandings;
because it would be easier for us to see where the obscurity
arose from •the nature of the thing under discussion and
where it arose merely from •the confused meanings of some
words.


**27.** _First_ then, it should be borne in mind that freedom
consists in the dependence on our volition ·or preference· of

an action’s being done _or not done_,
not in the dependence on our preference ·or volition· of

any action _or its contrary_ .
A man standing on a cliff is at liberty to leap twenty yards
downwards into the sea, not because he has a power to do
the contrary action, which is •to leap twenty yards upwards
(for he has no such power), but because he has a power to
leap or •not to leap. . . .
A prisoner in a room twenty feet
square, when he is at the north side of the room, is at liberty
to walk twenty feet southward because he can walk or •not
walk it; but he isn’t at the same time at liberty to do the
contrary, i.e. to •walk twenty feet northward.
Freedom, then,
consists in our being able to act or not to act according as we
shall choose or will. ·With that I leave the topic of freedom
until I re-engage with it in section 47·.


**28.** _Secondly_, we must remember that volition or willing is
an act of the mind directing its thought to the performing
of some action and thereby exerting its power to produce
it.
In the interests of brevity I ask permission to use the
word ‘action’ to include also refraining from action.
When
walking or speaking are proposed to the mind, _sitting still_
and _staying silent_ are mere non-actions, but they need the
determination of the will as much as _walking_ and _speaking_



do, and they are often as weighty in their consequences
as the other two, the real actions.
Those are reasons for
counting such refrainings as actions too, but anyway I am
doing so for brevity’s sake.


**29.** Thirdly, to the question _What determines the will?_ the
true answer is _The mind_ .
The will is the general power of
directing action this way or that; it is a power that the agent
has; and what determines its exercise in a given case is the
agent, the mind, exercising its power in some particular way.
If you aren’t satisfied with this answer, then you must be
asking _What determines the will?_ with the meaning _What_
_moves the mind, in every particular instance, to perform the_
_particular act of volition that it does perform?_ ·This is an
intelligible and respectable question, which doesn’t involve
treating the will as an agent or anything like that·.
To this
question I answer:

The motive for •continuing in the same state or action is one’s _present satisfaction_ in it; the motive to
•change is always some _uneasiness_ .
The only thing that ever leads us to will a change of state or
the performing of a new action is some uneasiness ·with our
present state or action·.
This is the great motive that works
on the mind, getting it to act.
For brevity’s sake I shall call
this _determining the will_ .
I shall explain it at more length.


**30.** First, though, I must say something about terminology.
Volition is a very simple act, and if you want to understand
what it is you will do better by •reflecting on your own mind
and observing what it does when it wills than by •any variety
of verbal explanations.
Yet I have tried to put it into familiar
words by using the terms ‘prefer’ and ‘choose’ and their
like, and these ·are not really right because they· signify
_desire_ as well as _volition_ . . . .
I find the will often confounded
with. . . .desire, and one put for the other. . . .
I think that this


has frequently led to obscurity and mistake in this matter,
and should be avoided as much as possible.
If you turn your
thought inwards onto what goes on in your mind when you
_will_, you’ll see that the will or power of volition has to do only
with actions and non-actions that the mind _takes to be in its_
_power_ .
So the will is quite different from desire, which may
go directly against the will in a particular case. [Locke gives
two examples, this being one: A man may be suffering pain,
knowing that the only way for him to relieve it would give
him other, worse, physical ailments.
So he _wants_ the pain
to go away, but he doesn’t _will_ any action that would make
it go away.] This makes it evident that desiring and willing
are two distinct acts of the mind, and thus that the will (the
power of volition) is distinct from desire.


**31.** To return then to the question _What determines the will_
_in regard to our actions?_ I used to accept the widespread
opinion—·to which I shall return in section 35·—that what
determines the will is _the greater good in view_ ; but I now
think that what does it is some _uneasiness_ that the man
is at present under.
That is what determines the will from
moment to moment, getting us to behave as we do.
This
uneasiness can be called _desire_, for that’s what it is: _desire_
_is an uneasiness of the mind for the lack of some absent good_ .
All bodily pain of whatever kind, and all disquiet of the mind,
is uneasiness; and it is always accompanied by—and indeed
is hardly to be distinguished from—a desire that is equal to
the pain or uneasiness that is being felt.
For desire being
an uneasiness in the lack of an absent good, in the case of
pain the absent good is _ease_, freedom from the pain; and
until ease is attained we can call the uneasiness ‘desire’, for
nobody feels pain without wanting to be eased of it, with a
desire equal ·in intensity· to that pain.
Besides this desire for
ease from pain—·which is essentially a desire for something



negative·—there is also desire for absent positive good; and
here also the desire and uneasiness are equal.
The more
strongly we desire any absent good the more intensely are
we in pain from not having it.
But the intensity of the pain
doesn’t vary with •how great the good is or is thought to
be—only with •the strength of the desire for it.
Absent good
can be contemplated without desire.
But when there _is_ desire
there is an equally intense uneasiness.


**32.** Everyone who reflects on himself will quickly find that
desire is a state of uneasiness.
Everyone has felt in desire
what the wise man says of hope (which isn’t much different
from it) ‘that it being deferred makes the heart sick’ [Proverbs

13:12], and that the greatness of the desire sometimes raises
the uneasiness to a level where it makes people cry out ‘Give
me children, give me the thing desired, or I die’ [Genesis 30:1].
Life itself, with all its enjoyments, is a burden that cannot
be borne under the lasting and unremoved pressure of such
an uneasiness.


**33.** It is true that good and evil, present and absent, work
on the mind; but what _immediately_ determines the will to
each voluntary action is the uneasiness of desire, fixed on
some absent good—whether the good be negative (such as
the absence of pain) or positive (such as pleasure).
I shall
now try to show, by argument and from experience, that it is
indeed this uneasiness that determines the will to the series
of voluntary actions of which the greatest part of our lives is
made up.


**34.** When a man is perfectly content with the state he is in,
and thus is without uneasiness, there is nothing to move
him to stop being in that state.
Observe yourself and you’ll
see that this is right.
And so we see that our All-wise Maker
has put into us the uneasiness of hunger and thirst and
other natural desires, which return at the proper time and


determine our wills for the preservation of ourselves and the
continuation of our species.
If the mere _thought_ of those
good ends had been sufficient to determine the will and set
us to work, it is reasonable to think we would then have had
none of these natural pains, and perhaps in this world little
or no pain at all. ‘It is better to marry than to burn’, says St.
Paul, [1 Corinthians 7:9] exhibiting what chiefly drives men into
the enjoyments of the married state.
There is more power
in •the push of a little _actual_ burning than •the pull of the
_prospect of_ greater pleasures.


**35.** It is so widely and confidently accepted that what
determines the will is _good, the greater good_, that I am
not surprised that I took this view for granted when I first
published on this topic ·in the first edition of this _Essay_ ·.
And I suspect that many readers will blame me not for
that but rather for my present retraction.
But when I
looked harder into the matter, I was forced to conclude that
even what a person _knows to be_ the greater good doesn’t
determine his will until his desire has been correspondingly
raised and has made him uneasy in his lack of the good
in question. [Locke gives the example of a poor man who
agrees that affluence is better than poverty, but who isn’t
uneasy over his poverty and therefore doesn’t bestir himself
to get rich; and the example of a man who knows that virtue
brings advantages, but who does nothing about it because
he doesn’t ‘hunger and thirst after righteousness’.
He writes
colourfully of the alcoholic whose knowledge of what would
be better for him leads him frequently to resolve to give up
drinking, but doesn’t lead him actually to give it up because]
the uneasiness to miss his accustomed delight returns, the
acknowledged greater good loses its hold, and the present
_uneasiness_ determines his will to start drinking again.
He
may at the same time make secret promises to himself that



he won’t drink any more—that this is the last time he’ll act
against the attainment of those greater goods.
And thus he
is from time to time in the state of that unhappy complainer
who said _Though I see and approve the better, I follow the_
_worse_ .
We have constant experience of the truth of this for
many people at many times; I know of no way except mine
to make this fact intelligible.


**36.** Experience makes it evident that uneasiness alone
operates on the will; but _why_ is this so? ·In answering this,
I shall assume that whenever volition occurs there is some
uneasiness, the question being why _it_ and not something
else acts immediately on the will in every case·.
The answer
is that at any given time only one item can determine our
will, and it naturally happens that uneasiness takes that role
·to the exclusion of anything else that might take it·.
The
reason for that is that while we are in a state of uneasiness
we can’t sense ourselves as being happy or on the way to
happiness, because everyone finds that pain and uneasiness
are inconsistent with happiness, spoiling the savour even
of the good things that we do have.
So our will always, as
a matter of course, chooses the removing of any pain ·or
uneasiness· that we still have, as the first and necessary
step towards happiness.


**37.** Here is another possible reason why the will is
·immediately· determined only by the will ·and not by the
prospect of greater good.
The greater good is only prospective, lying in a possible future; it isn’t _present_ and actual.
Uneasiness is the only relevant factor that is · _present_ ; and it
is against the nature of things that something _absent_ should
operate where it is not. ·So a merely _future_ possible good
cannot operate in the actual _present_ .· You may object that
absent good can, through thought, be brought home to the
mind and made to be present.
The idea of it may indeed be


in the mind and viewed as present there; but for •something
that is in the mind in that way to counter-balance the
removal of an uneasiness that we have, •it must raise our
desire to a point where the uneasiness of _that_ prevails over
the other uneasiness in determining the will.
Until that
happens, the idea in the mind of some good is there only
in the way other ideas are, as merely something to think
about—not operating on the will and not setting us to work.
(I shall give the reason for this shortly.). . . .


[In section **38** Locke writes at length about the fact of sinful
conduct by people who really do believe that they are risking
the loss of eternal joy in heaven.
This would be inexplicable
if mere unaided beliefs about the good could determine the
will, because in that case _those_ beliefs would surely always
prevail.
But their frequent failure to do so can be understood
if one brings in Locke’s thesis that uneasiness is what determines the will.
Near the end he writes:] Any intense pain of
the body, the ungovernable passion of a man violently in love,
or the impatient desire for revenge, keeps the will steady and
focussed; and the will that is thus determined never lets the
understanding set its object aside; all the thoughts of the
mind and powers of the body are uninterruptedly employed
in one direction by the determination of the will, which is
influenced by that towering uneasiness as long as it lasts. . . .
·That completes my defence of my view that uneasiness is
always what immediately determines the will.
The notion of
uneasiness will go on working for me, but won’t itself be the
topic of further discussion·.


**39.** Up to here my examples of uneasiness have mainly
concerned desire.
That kind of uneasiness is the chief
determinant of desire, and the one we are most conscious
of; and it seldom happens that the will orders an action
without some desire being involved. (I think that is why



the will and desire are so often taken to be one and the
same thing.) Still, some part in the story should be given
to kinds of uneasiness that make up or at least accompany
the other passions.
_Aversion_, _fear_, _anger_, _envy_, _shame_, etc.
each have their uneasiness too, which is how they influence
the will.
Each of those passions usually comes mixed with
others,. . . .and I think that desire is nearly always an element
in the mix.
I am sure that wherever there is uneasiness there
is desire.
Here is why: we constantly desire happiness; and
to the extent that we feel uneasiness, to that extent we lack
happiness ·and therefore desire to have it·. . . .
Also, the
present moment is not our eternity!
However greatly we are
enjoying the present, we look beyond it to the future, and
desire goes with that foresight, and it carries the will with it.
So that even in joy, what keeps up the action on which the
enjoyment depends is the _desire_ to continue it and the _fear_
of losing it. . . .


**40.** We are attacked by various uneasinesses, distracted by
different desires, which raises the question: which of them
takes precedence in determining the will to the next action?
The answer is that ordinarily it the _most pressing_ of them.
(That is, the most pressing of the ones that the person thinks
_can_ be removed; for the will can never be moved towards
something it then thinks is unattainable. . . .) What ordinarily
determines the will in that series of voluntary actions that
makes up our lives is at each moment the most important
and urgent uneasiness that we feel at that time.
Don’t lose
sight of the fact that the proper and only object of the will is
_some action of ours_, and nothing else.
The only outcome we
can produce by willing is an action of our own, so that is as
far as our will reaches.


**41.** If it is further asked _What is it that moves desire?_, I
answer: Happiness, and that alone. ‘Happiness’ and ‘misery’


are the names of two extremes whose outer bounds we
don’t know. . . .
But we have very lively impressions of some
degrees of each, made by various instances of delight and
joy on the one side, and torment and sorrow on the other.
For brevity’s sake I shall bring all these under the labels
‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’, because there is pleasure and pain of
the mind as well as of the body. . . .
Indeed, strictly speaking
they are all of the mind, though some arise in the mind from
thought, others in the body from certain modifications of
motion.


**42.** _Happiness_ then in its full extent is the utmost pleasure
we are capable of, and _misery_ the utmost pain. . . .
Now
because pleasure and pain are produced in us by the operation of certain objects on our minds or our bodies, and in
different degrees, anything that is apt to produce pleasure
in us we call ‘good’, and what is apt to produce pain we call
‘bad’, _just_ because it is apt to produce in us the pleasure or
pain that constitutes our happiness or misery.
Further, even
when what is apt to bring us some degree of pleasure is in
itself good, and what is apt to produce some degree of pain
is bad, we often don’t call it so because it is in competition
with a •greater of its sort. . . .
If we rightly estimate what we
call ‘good’ and ‘bad’, we shall find it lies to a large extent in
•comparison: the cause of every lesser degree of pain, as well
as every greater degree of pleasure, has the nature of good,
and vice versa.


**43.** Although good is the proper object of desire in general,
sometimes a man’s desire remains unmoved by the prospect
of good, because he doesn’t regard that good as a necessary part of his happiness.
Everyone constantly pursues
happiness, and desires whatever contributes to it; _other_
acknowledged goods a person can look at without desire,
pass by, and be content to go without.
There is pleasure in



knowledge, and many men are drawn to sensual pleasures.
Now, let one man place his satisfaction in sensual pleasures,
another in the delight of knowledge; each admits there is
great pleasure in what the other pursues; yet neither makes
the thing that delights the other a part of _his_ happiness,
and their desires are not moved that way. (As soon as the
studious man’s hunger and thirst make him uneasy,. . . .his
desire is directed towards eating and drinking, though possibly not caring much _what_ food he gets to eat.
And on
the other side, the epicure buckles down to study when
shame, or the desire to look good to his mistress, makes
him uneasy in his lack of some sort of knowledge.) Thus,
however intent men are in their pursuit of happiness, a
man may have a clear view of good—great and acknowledged
good—without being concerned for it or moved by it, if he
thinks he can be happy without it.
But men are always
concerned about pain, ·which is an intense uneasiness·.
They can feel no uneasiness without being moved by it.
And
therefore whenever they are uneasy from their lack of some
good that they think they need for their happiness, they start
to desire it.


**44.** Something that each of us can observe in himself is
this: although •the greater visible good doesn’t always raise a
man’s desires in proportion to the greatness he acknowledges
it to have, •every little trouble moves us and sets us to work
to get rid of it.
The nature of our happiness and misery
makes it evident why this should be so.
Any present pain, of
whatever kind, makes a part of our present misery; but the
absence of a good doesn’t necessarily do so.
If it always did,
we would be constantly and infinitely miserable, because
there are infinite degrees of happiness that we don’t possess.
So when we are free of all uneasiness, a moderate portion of
good is enough to keep us content in the present; and a fairly


low level of pleasure in a series of ordinary enjoyments adds
up to a happiness with which most of us can be satisfied. (If
this were not so, there’d be no room for the obviously trivial
actions that we so often exercise our wills on, voluntarily
spending much of our lives on them—a pattern of conduct
that couldn’t persist if our will or desire were constantly
directed towards the greatest apparent good.) Few people
need go far afield to be convinced that this is so.
In this life,
indeed, most people who are happy to the extent of having
a constant series of _moderate_ pleasures with no admixture
of uneasiness would be content to continue in •this life for
ever; even though they can’t deny that there _may be_ a state
of eternal durable joys in an •after-life, far surpassing all the
good that is to be found in this one.
In fact they can’t avoid
realizing that such a wonderful after-life is _more_ possible
than is their getting and keeping the pittance of honour,
riches, or pleasure that they are now pursuing to the neglect
of that eternal state.
And yet,

•with a clear view of this difference, •satisfied of the
possibility of a perfect, secure, and lasting happiness
in a future state, and •quite sure that it is not to be
had in this life while they limit their happiness to
some little enjoyment and exclude the joys of heaven
from making a necessary part of it,

_still_ their desires are not moved by this greater apparent
good, nor are their wills determined to any action or effort
towards its attainment.


[In section **45** Locke discusses at length the phenomenon of
people not being moved to seek what they believe are very
great long-term goods because their wills are activated by
little present uneasinesses aimed at smaller goods that they
think of as necessary for their happiness.
These dominant
uneasinesses may be for food, drink and so on, but there



are also ‘fantastical’ uneasinesses directed at honour, power,
riches, etc. ‘and a thousand other irregular desires that
custom has made natural to us’.
When we are in pain,
misery, uneasiness, Locke says, the first thing we need, in
order to become happy, is to get out of that state; and in that
situation:] the absence of absent good does not contribute to
our unhappiness, and so the thought of absent good—even
if we have it, and admit that the item in question _would_ be
good—is pushed aside to make way for the removal of the
uneasinesses that we feel.
This situation will change only if
appropriate and repeated contemplation of an absent good
•brings it nearer to our mind, •gives us a taste of that good,
and •raises in us some desire.
That desire then starts to
contribute to our present uneasiness, and competes with
our other uneasinesses in the push to be satisfied; and if it
exerts enough pressure it will in its turn come to determine
the will.


**46.** By thoroughly examining any proposed good, we can
raise our desires to a level that is proportional to _how good_
it is, and then it may come to work on the will, and be
pursued. . . .wills are influenced only by the uneasinesses
that are present to us; while we have any of those they are
always soliciting, always ready at hand to give the will its
next push.
When any balancing goes on in the mind, ·it isn’t
a balancing of prospective goods against one another; rather·
it concerns only which desire will be the next to be satisfied,
which uneasiness the next to be removed.
So it comes about
that as long as any uneasiness, any desire, remains in our
mind, there is no room for good—considered just in itself as
_good_ —to come at the will or to have any influence on it. . . .


**47.** Despite what I have said ·in section 40·, it doesn’t
_always_ happen that the greatest and most pressing uneasiness determines the will to the next action.
As we find in


our own experience, the mind is usually able to _suspend_
_acting_ on some one of its desires, and so—taking them
one at a time—to suspend acting on any of them.
Having
done this, the mind is at liberty to consider the objects
of its desires—·the states of affairs that it wants to bring
about·—to examine them on all sides and weigh them against
others.
In this lies man’s liberty; and all the mistakes, errors,
and faults that we run into in living our lives and pursuing
happiness arise from not availing ourselves of this liberty,
and instead rushing into the determination of our wills, going
into action before thinking enough about what we are aiming
at. ability to suspend the pursuit of this or that desire seems
to me to be the source of all freedom; it is what so-called
‘free will’ consists in.
When we exercise it and _then_ act, we
have done our duty, all that we can or ought to do in pursuit
of our happiness; and it isn’t a _fault_ but a _perfection_ of our
nature to desire, will, and act according to the last result of
a fair examination.


**48.** This is so far from confining or weakening our freedom,
that it is the very essence of it; it doesn’t cut short our
liberty, but brings it to its proper goal; and the further
we are removed from such a determination—·that is, from
being made to act by the judgments we have made and the
uneasinesses that result from them·—the nearer we are to
misery and slavery.
If the mind were perfectly indifferent

[= ‘in perfect balance’] about how to act, not fixed by its last
judgment of the good or evil that is thought to attend its
choice, that would be a great imperfection in it.
A man is at
liberty to lift his hand to his head, or let it rest in his lap; he
is perfectly indifferent as between these, and it would be an
imperfection in him if he lacked that power—·that is, if he
were unable to lift his hand, or unable not to lift it, given that
no desire of his selects one course of action rather than the



other·.
But it would be as great an imperfection if he had the
same indifference as between lifting his hand and not lifting
it in a situation where by raising it he would save himself
from a blow that he sees coming.
It is as much a perfection
that desire (or the power of preferring) should be determined
by good as that the power of acting should be determined
by the will; and the more certain such determination is, the
greater is the perfection.
Indeed, if we were determined by
anything _but_ the last result of our judgments about the good
or evil of an action, _we would not be free_ . . . .


**49.** If we think about those superior beings above us who
enjoy perfect happiness—·that is, the angels in heaven·—we
shall have reason to judge that they are more steadily
determined in their choice of good than we are; and yet
we have no reason to think they are less happy or less free.
And if such poor finite creatures as us were entitled to say
anything about what infinite wisdom and goodness could do,
I think we might say that God himself _cannot_ choose what is
not good; his freedom does not prevent his being determined
by what is best.


**50.** Would anyone choose to be an imbecile so as to be
less determined by wise thoughts than a wise man?
Is it
worth the name of ‘freedom’ to be at liberty to play the fool,
and draw shame and misery upon oneself?
Breaking loose
from the conduct of reason, and lacking that restraint of
examination and judgment that keeps us from choosing or
doing the worse—if _that_ is liberty, true liberty, then madmen
and fools are the only free men!
Anyone who chose to be
mad for the sake of such ‘liberty’ would have to be mad
already.
I don’t think that anybody thinks that our liberty
is restricted in a way we might complain of by the fact that
we are constrained to act so as to secure the happiness
that we constantly desire.
God Almighty himself is under


the necessity of being happy; and the more any thinking
being is under that necessity, the nearer it comes to infinite
perfection and happiness.
To protect us—ignorant and
short-sighted creatures that we are—from mistakes about
true happiness, we have been given a power to suspend
any particular desire and keep it from determining the will
and engaging us in action.
This is •standing still when we
aren’t sure enough of which way to go.
Examination ·of
the possibilities· is •consulting a guide.
The determination
of the will after enquiry is •following the direction of that
guide.
And someone who has a power to act or not to act,
according as such determination of the will directs, is free;
such determination doesn’t limit the power in which liberty
consists.
Someone who has his chains knocked off and the
prison doors opened for him is perfectly at liberty, because
he can either go or stay, as he chooses, even if his preference
is determined to stay because of the darkness of the night,
the badness of the weather, or his lack of anywhere else
to sleep.
He doesn’t stop being free, although his desire
for some convenience gives him a preference—all things
considered—for staying in his prison.


[Section **51** continues with this theme.]


**52.** The liberty of thinking beings in their constant pursuit of
true happiness turns on the hinge of their ability in particular
cases to

suspend this pursuit until they have looked forward
·in time· and informed themselves about whether
the particular thing they want and are considering
pursuing really does lie on the way to their main end,
really does make a part of the ·happiness· that is their
greatest good.
By their nature they are drawn towards happiness, and that
requires them to take care not to mistake or miss it; and so



it demands that they be cautious, deliberate, and wary about
how they act in pursuit of it.
Whatever necessity requires us
to pursue real happiness, the same necessity with the same
force requires us to suspend action, to deliberate, and to look
carefully at each successive desire with a view to discovering
whether the satisfaction of it—·rather than promoting our
happiness·—won’t interfere with our true happiness and lead
us away from it.
This, it seems to me, is the great privilege
of finite thinking beings; and I ask you to think hard about
whether the following isn’t true:


The course of men’s behaviour depends on what use
they make of their ability to suspend their desires
and stop them from determining their wills to any
action until they have examined the good and evil of
the contemplated action, fairly and with as much care
as its importance merits.
This ability is what brings
freedom into the lives of men—all the freedom they
have, all they can have, all that can be useful to them.
This ·suspension of desire, followed by deliberation·,
is something we _can_ do, and when we have done it we
have done our duty, all we can do, all we need to do.

Since the will needs knowledge to guide its choice, all we can
do is to hold our wills undetermined until we have examined
the good and evil of what we desire.
What follows after that
follows in a chain of consequences linked one to another,
all depending on the last ruling of the judgment; and we
have power over whether that ruling comes from a hasty and
precipitate view or from a due and mature examination.


[In section **53** Locke writes about how greatly people vary in
their tastes and in what they think would make them happy,
and urges the importance of our exercising our _freedom_
to suspend judgment and give ourselves time for further
reflection and enquiry.
In extreme cases one can’t do this,


for example a man under torture may be unable to refrain
from telling his torturers _right now_ what they want to know.
And ‘love, anger, or any other violent passion’ may have
the same effect.
But we should work on freeing ourselves
from being dominated in that manner.
He continues:] In
this we should •take trouble to bring it about that whether
something is to our mind’s taste depends on the real intrinsic
good or bad that is in it, and •not permit an admitted or
supposed possible great good to slip out of our thoughts
without leaving any taste of itself, any desire for it, until by
adequate thought about its true worth we form an appetite
in our mind that is suitable to it, and make ourselves uneasy
in the lack of it or in the fear of losing it. . . .
Let no-one
say he _can’t_ govern his passions, can’t prevent them from
taking over and sweeping him into action; for what you can
do before a prince or a great man you can do alone or in the
presence of God, if you want to.


**54** .
How does it come about that, although all men desire
happiness, their wills carry them in such contrary directions
and thus carry some of them to do bad things?
What I have
said makes it easy to answer this, which I do as follows.
The various and contrary choices that men make show •not
that they don’t all pursue good but •rather that different
people find different things good—that we don’t all place our
happiness in the same thing, or choose the same way to get
it.
If we were concerned only with how things go in this life,
the explanation of why •one man devotes himself to study
and knowledge and •another to hawking and hunting, why
•one chooses luxury and debauchery and •another sobriety
and riches, would not be because some of these didn’t aim
at their own happiness but because different things make
them happy.
So the physician was right in what he said to
his patient who had sore eyes: ‘If you get more pleasure from



the taste of wine than from the use of your sight, wine is
good for you; but if the pleasure of seeing is greater to you
than that of drinking, wine is bad.’


**55.** The mind has its own taste for things, as well as the
palate; and you’ll do no better trying to delight all men with
riches or glory. . . .than trying to satisfy all men’s hunger with
cheese or lobsters. . . .
As •pleasant tastes depend not on the
things themselves but on how they suit this or that particular palate (and palates vary greatly), so also •the greatest
happiness consists in having the things that produce the
greatest pleasure and not having any that cause disturbance
or pain.
Now these, to different men, are very different
things.
So if men have nothing to hope for in an after-life,
if _this_ is the only life in which they can enjoy anything, it
is neither strange nor unreasonable that they should seek
their happiness by avoiding all the things that disease them
here and pursuing all that delight them ·here·—and it’s not
surprising that there should be much variety and difference
among these.
For if there is no prospect beyond the grave,
the inference is certainly right: ‘let us eat and drink,’ let us
enjoy what we delight in, ‘for tomorrow we shall die’ [Isaiah

22:13].
This, I think, may serve to show us why men pursue
different ends even though the desires of all of them are
bent on happiness.
It can happen that men choose different
things and they all choose rightly—if we suppose them ·to
have no prospect of an after-life, which involves supposing
them· to be merely like a crowd of poor insects—some of
them bees delighting in flowers and their sweetness, others
beetles enjoying other kinds of food—all of them able to enjoy
themselves for a season, after which they go out of existence
for ever.


**56.** . . . .Liberty plainly consists in a power to do or not to
do, as we choose.
This much in undeniable; but it seems to


cover only the actions of a man resulting from his volition, so
there remains the question _Is he at liberty to will or not?’_ ·In
sections 23–4· I have answered that in most cases a man isn’t
at liberty to refrain from the act of volition: he must exert an
act of his will through which the proposed action is done or
·one through which it is· not done.
Still, in one kind of case
a man _is_ at liberty in respect of willing, namely in choosing
a remote good as an end to be pursued.
Here a man can
suspend choosing either for or against the thing proposed
until he has examined whether it really is—or really will
lead to—something that will make him happy.
Once he has
chosen it, thereby making it a part of his happiness, it raises
desire, which gives him a corresponding uneasiness, which
determines his will, which sets him to work in pursuit of his
choice.
This shows us how a man can deserve punishment,
even though in all his particular actions he _necessarily_ wills
what he then judges to be good.
His will is always determined
by whatever is judged good by his understanding, but that
doesn’t excuse him if _by a too hasty choice_ of his own making
he has adopted wrong measures of good and evil—judgments
which, however false they are, have the same influence on
all his future conduct as if they were true.
He has spoiled
his own palate, and must take responsibility for the sickness
and death that follows from that. . . .
What I have said may
help to show us why men prefer different things and pursue
happiness by contrary courses.
But since men are always
constant and in earnest about happiness and misery, the
question still remains _How do men come to prefer the worse_
_to the better_, and to choose what they admit has made them
miserable?


[In section **57** Locke sketches an answer to his question.
Some of the variation, and especially some of the conduct
that isn’t conducive to the happiness of the agent, is due to **1**



‘causes not in our power’, such as extreme pain, overwhelming terror, and so on.
The other source of counterproductive
behaviour is **2** wrong judgment.
Locke deals briefly with **1** in
this section, and devotes sections 58–68 to **2** .]


**58.** I shall first consider the wrong judgments men make
of future good and evil, whereby their desires are misled.
Nobody can be wrong about whether his present state,
considered just in itself and apart from its consequences,
is one of happiness or misery.
Apparent and real good are
in this case always the same; and so if every action of ours
ended within itself and had no consequences, we would never
err in our choice of good; we would always infallibly prefer
the best. . . .


**59.** But our voluntary actions don’t carry along •with them
in their present performance all the happiness and misery
that •depend on them.
They are _prior_ causes of good and evil
that come to us _after_ the actions themselves have passed
and no longer exist.
So our desires look beyond our present
enjoyments, and carry the mind forward to any absent good
that we think is needed to create or increase our happiness.
The absent good gets its attraction from the belief that it is
needed for happiness.
Without that belief we are not moved
by absent good.
In this life we are accustomed to having
a narrow range, in which we enjoy only one pleasure at a
time; and when we have such a single pleasure and have
no uneasiness, the pleasure is enough to make us think we
are happy; and we aren’t affected by all remote good, even
when we are aware of it.
Because our present enjoyment
and freedom from pain suffices to make us happy, we don’t
want to risk making any change. . . .
But as soon as any new
uneasiness comes in, our happiness is disturbed and we are
set to work again in the pursuit of happiness.


**60.** One common reason why men often are not raised to the
desire for the greatest absent good is their tendency to think
they can be happy without it.
While they think _that_, the joys
of a future state don’t move them; they have little concern or
uneasiness; and the will, free from the determination of such
desires ·for distant-future goods·, is left to pursue nearer
satisfactions, removing those uneasinesses that it feels from
its lack of them and its longing for them. [The remainder
of this section develops this line of thought, applying it
especially to those who ignore the prospects of the after-life
in their pursuit of relatively trivial earthly pursuits.
The
section concludes:] For someone who—·unlike a bee or a
beetle·—has a prospect of the different state that awaits all
men after this life, a state of perfect happiness or of misery
depending on their behaviour here, the measures of good
and evil that govern his choice are utterly changed.
For no
pleasure or pain in this life can be remotely comparable to
the endless happiness or intense misery of an immortal soul
in the after-life, so his choices about how to act will depend
not on the passing pleasure or pain that accompanies or
follows them •here but on whether they serve to secure that
perfect durable happiness •hereafter.


**61.** To understand in more detail the way men often
bring misery on themselves, although they all earnestly
pursue happiness, we must consider how things come to be
_mis_ represented to our desires.
That is done by the ·faculty of·
judgment telling untruths about them.
To see what causes
wrong judgments, and what their scope is, we must note
that things are judged good or bad in a double sense.
In the
strict and proper sense, only pleasure is good, only pain bad.
But things that draw pleasure and pain after them are also
considered as good and bad, because our desires—those of
any creature with foresight—aim not only at present pleasure



and pain but also at whatever is apt to cause pleasure or
pain for us at a later time.


**62.** The wrong judgment that often misleads us and makes
the will choose the worse option lies in misreporting the
various comparisons of these ·consequences that I have just
mentioned·.
I am not talking about one person’s opinion
about someone else’s choices, but of the choices a man
makes that he himself eventually admits were wrong.
Now,
it is certain that every thinking being seeks happiness,
which consists in the enjoyment of pleasure without much
uneasiness mixed into it; and it is impossible that anyone
should willingly slip something nasty into his own drink, or
leave out anything in his power that would help to complete
his happiness—impossible, that is, unless he has made a
wrong judgment. . . . ·Such judgments are of two kinds: **1**
about the relative goodness or badness of items considered
just in themselves, and **2** about what the consequences will
be of various items.
I’ll discuss **1** in sections 63–5, and
**2** in sections 66–7.
Yet another kind of judgment will be
discussed in section 68·.


**63.** When we compare _present_ pleasure or pain with _future_
(which is usually the case in most important questions about
what to do), we often make wrong judgments about them,
measuring them differently because of our different temporal
distances from them.
Nearby objects are apt to be thought to
be bigger than ones that are actually bigger but are further
away; and so it is with pleasures and pains, with which
_the present_ is apt to win the contest.
Thus most men, like
spendthrift heirs, are apt to judge a little in hand to be
better than a great deal to come.
But everyone must agree—
whatever his values are—that this is a wrong judgment.
That
which is future will certainly come to be present, and then,
having the same advantage of nearness, will show itself in


its full size, revealing the mistake of someone who judged it
by unequal measures. [In the remainder of the section Locke
develops this point at some length, with special reference to
the drinker who knows he’ll have a hangover in the morning.]


**64.** It is because of the weak and narrow constitution of
our minds that we judge wrongly when comparing present
pleasure or pain with future.
We can’t thoroughly enjoy two
pleasures at once, much less enjoy a pleasure—with a few
exceptions—while pain possesses us.
A present pleasure, if
it isn’t feeble to the point of hardly being a pleasure, fills our
narrow souls, taking up the whole mind so as to leave hardly
any room for thoughts of absent things.
Even if among
our pleasures there are some that aren’t strong enough to
exclude thoughts about things in the future, we so intensely
hate pain that a little of it extinguishes all our pleasures.
So
we come to desire to be rid of the present evil, whatever the
cost; we are apt to think that nothing absent can equal it,
because in our present pain we find ourselves incapable of
any degree of happiness. . . .
Nothing, we passionately think,
can exceed—hardly anything can _equal_ —the uneasiness that
now sits so heavily on us.
And _not_ having a present pleasure
that is available is a pain, often a very great one, with one’s
desire being inflamed by a near and tempting object.
So it
is no wonder that _that_ operates in the same way that pain
does, lessens future goods in our thoughts, and so forces
us blindfold (so to speak) into the embraces of the nearby
pleasure.


[In section **65** Locke makes the point that in our judgments
about possible future pleasure ‘of a sort we are unacquainted
with’ we are apt, if that pleasure is in competition with
something that is closer in time, to underestimate the former
on the ground that if we actually had it we would find that
it didn’t live up to its billing.
He continues:] But this way



of thinking is wrong when applied to the happiness of the
after-life. . . .
For that life is intended ·by God· to be a state
of happiness, so it must certainly be agreeable to everyone’s
wish and desire. . . .
The manna in heaven will suit everyone’s
palate. . . .


**66.** When there is a question of some action’s being good
or bad in its consequences, we have two ways of judging
wrongly. **1** We may underestimate _how_ bad a given bad
consequence would be. **2** We may underestimate the probability that a given bad upshot _will_ be a consequence of
the proposed action—allowing ourselves to believe wrongly
that the threatened consequence may somehow be avoided,
e.g. by hard work, skill, nimbleness, change of character,
repentance, etc.
I could show, case by case, that these are
wrong ways of judging; but I shall merely offer the following
general point.
It is very wrong and irrational to risk losing
a greater good in order to get a lesser one on the basis of
uncertain guesses and before the matter has been examined
as thoroughly as its importance demands.
Everyone must
agree with this, I think, especially if he considers the usual
causes of this wrong judgment, of which I now describe
three.


**67.** One is ignorance.
Someone who judges without informing himself as fully as he can is guilty of judging amiss.
The second is carelessness, when a man overlooks things
that he _does_ know.
This is a sort of self-induced temporary
ignorance, which misleads our judgments as much as the
other.
Judging is like balancing an account to see whether
there is profit or loss; so if either column is added up in a
rush, resulting in the omission of some figures that ought to
be included, this haste causes as wrong a judgment as if it
were perfect ignorance.
What usually causes it is the domination by some present pleasure or pain. understanding and


reason were given us so that we won’t rush in, but instead
will search and see and _then_ judge.
Understanding without
liberty would be useless, and liberty without understanding
(if there could be such a thing) would signify nothing.
If a
man sees what would do him good or harm, make him happy
or miserable, without being able to move one step towards or
from it, what good is it to him that he sees it?
And if someone
is at liberty to ramble in perfect darkness, how is his liberty
any better than if he were driven up and down as a bubble
by the force of the wind?
Being acted on by a blind impulse
from •within oneself is no better than being acted on by one
from •outside.
So the first great use of liberty is to hinder
blind headlong rushing; the principal exercise of freedom is
to stand still, open the eyes, look around, and take a view
of the consequences of what we are going to do—doing all
this with as much thoroughness as the weight of the matter
requires.
I shan’t here explore this matter further. . . .
I shall
consider only one other kind of false judgment, which I think
I ought to mention because it has great influence though it
may usually be overlooked.


**68.** All men desire happiness, that’s past doubt; but when
they are rid of pain they are apt to settle for any pleasure
that is readily available or that they have grown to be fond
of, and to be satisfied with that, and thus to be happy until
some new desire disturbs that happiness and shows them
that they are not happy.
Some goods exclude others; we
can’t have them all; so we don’t fix our desires on every
apparent greater good unless we judge it to be necessary
to our happiness; if we _think we can be happy without it_,
it doesn’t move us.
This brings up a third way in which
men judge wrongly, namely by thinking something not to
be necessary to their happiness when really it is so.
This
can mislead us •in our choice of goods to aim at and •in the



means we adopt to achieve a good.
We are encouraged to
think that some good would not contribute to our happiness
by the real or supposed unpleasantness of the actions needed
to achieve it, for we tend to find it so absurd that we should
_make ourselves unhappy_ in order to _achieve happiness_ that
we don’t easily bring ourselves to it.


**69.** ·We now come to a fourth and final kind of error—not
exactly an error of _judgment_ —that men can make in their
approach to issues concerning goods and happiness.
Before
presenting it, we need to grasp a background fact·.
It is
evident that in many cases a man has it in his power to
change the pleasantness and unpleasantness that accompanies a given sort of action.
It’s a mistake to think that
men can’t come to take pleasure in something they used
to dislike or regard with indifference.
In some cases they
can do it just by careful thinking; in most cases they can
do it by practice, application, and habit.
Bread or tobacco
may be neglected even when they are shown to be useful to
health, because of an indifference or dislike for them.
But
thought about the matter recommends that they be tried,
and if they are tried the person finds that they are pleasant
after all, or else through frequent use they _become_ pleasant
to him.
This holds in the case of virtue also.
Actions are
pleasing or displeasing, either in themselves or considered
as a means to a greater and more desirable end. [Locke the
makes the point that •careful thought about the good to be
attained may make one _reconciled to the unpleasantness_ of
the means to it, whereas •‘use and practice’ can lead one to
_enjoy_ those means, finding them pleasant after all.] Habits
have powerful charms.
They put so much easiness and
pleasure into what we accustom ourselves to doing that we
can’t give it up without uneasiness.
Though this ·fact about
human nature· is very visible, and everyone’s experience


displays it to him, it is much neglected as a help to men
in their achievement of happiness.
So neglected, indeed,
that many people will think it paradoxical to say ·as I do·
that men can make things or actions more or less pleasing
to themselves, and in that way remedy something that is
responsible for great deal of their wandering. . . .


**70.** I shan’t go on about how men mislead themselves by
wrong judgments and neglect of what is in their power.
That
would make a volume, and it isn’t my business. ·But there
is one point about it that I shall present here because it is so
important·.
If someone is so unreasonable as to fail to think
hard about _infinite_ happiness and misery, he isn’t using his
understanding as he should.
The •rewards and punishments
of the after-life that the Almighty has established as the
enforcements of his law have enough weight to determine the
choice, against • _whatever_ pleasure or pain this life can show.
For this to be so, the eternal state has only to be regarded as
a bare _possibility_, and nobody could question that.
Exquisite
and endless happiness is a possible consequence of a good
life here, and the contrary state the possible reward of a
bad one; and someone who accepts this must admit that
his judgment is wrong if he doesn’t conclude that a virtuous
life (which may bring the certain expectation of everlasting
bliss) is to be preferred to a vicious one (with the fear of that
dreadful state of misery that may overtake the guilty, or at
best the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation).
This would
obviously hold good even if the virtuous life here had nothing
but pain, and the vicious one brought continual pleasure;
which in fact is far from the case. . . .
The •worst that comes
to the pious man if he is _wrong_ ·is that there is no after-life,
which· is the •best that the wicked man can get if he is _right._
With ·possible· infinite happiness on the virtue side of the
balance and ·possible· infinite misery on the vice side, it



would be _madness_ to choose the latter. . . . •If the good man
is right, he will be eternally happy; if he is wrong, he won’t
be miserable—he won’t feel anything.
On the other side, •if
the wicked man is right, he won’t be happy (·he won’t feel
anything·); if he is wrong, he’ll be infinitely miserable. . . .
I have said nothing about the certainty or _probability_ of
a future state, because I have wanted to show the wrong
judgment that anyone must admit that he is making— _on his_
_own principles_ —if he prefers the short pleasures of a vicious
life while he is certain that an after-life is at least _possible_ .


**71.** . . . .In correcting a slip that I had made in the first
edition of this work, I was led to my present view about
human liberty ·which I now repeat, before arguing against a
rival view that I didn’t mention earlier·.


_Liberty_ is a power to act or not act according as the
mind directs.
A power to direct the operative faculties
to motion or rest in particular instances is _the will_ .
What determines the will to any change of operation
is some present _uneasiness_, which is—or at least is
always accompanied by— _desire_ .
Desire is always
moved to avoid evil, because a total freedom from
pain is always a necessary part of our happiness.
But a ·prospective· greater good may fail to move
desire, because it doesn’t make a necessary part of the
person’s happiness or because he thinks it doesn’t.
All
that we ever desire is to be happy.
But although this
general desire of happiness operates constantly and
invariably, the satisfaction of any particular desire
can be suspended from determining the will until we
have maturely examined whether the apparent good in
question really does make a part of our real happiness.
What we judge as a result of that examination is what
ultimately determines us.
A man couldn’t be free if


•his will were determined by anything other than •his
own desire, guided by •his own judgment.


I know that some people equate a man’s liberty with his being,
before his will is determined, _indifferent_ —·that is, able to go
either way·.
I wish those who lay so much stress on this
supposed indifference had told us plainly whether it comes
•before the thought and judgment of the understanding as
well as •before the decree of the will. ·It may seem that they
have to say that it does·.
For it is pretty hard to place the
indifference between them, that is, immediately _after_ the
judgment of the understanding and _before_ the determination
of the will; because the determination of the will _immediately_
follows the judgment of the understanding.
On the other
hand, to equate liberty with an indifference that _precedes_
the thought and judgment of the understanding places it
in such darkness that we can neither see nor say anything
of it.
At any rate, it gives ‘liberty’ to something that isn’t
capable of having it, because we all agree that no agent is
capable of liberty except as a _consequence_ of thought and
judgment.
If liberty is to consist in indifference, then, it must
be an indifference that remains after the judgment of the
understanding and indeed after the determination of the will
·because, as we have seen, it cannot occur before both, and
cannot come between them either·.
That, however, isn’t •an
indifference of _the man_ .
He has judged whether it is best to
act or not to act ·and has decided or chosen accordingly·,
so _he_ isn’t now indifferent.
Rather, it is •an indifference of
his operative powers: they are equally able to operate and
to refrain from operating now, _after_ the will’s decree, just
as they were _before_ it; if you want to call this ‘indifference’,
do so!
This indifference gives a man a kind of freedom: for
example, I have the ability to move my hand or to let it
rest; that operative power is ‘indifferent’ as between moving
and not moving; I am then in that respect perfectly free.



My will determines that operative power to keep my hand
still; but I am free, because my operative power remains
indifferent as between moving and not moving; my will has
ordered the keeping-still of my hand, but the _power to move_
_it_ hasn’t been lost or even lessened; _that power_ ’s indifference
as between moving and not moving is just as it was before
the will commanded, as can be seen if the will puts it to the
trial by ordering that my hand move.
It would be otherwise
if my hand were suddenly paralysed, or (on the other side)
if it were set moving by a convulsion; in those cases, the
indifference of the operative faculty is lost.
That is the only
sort of indifference that has anything to do with liberty.


[Section **72** opens with Locke saying that he has spent so
long on liberty because of the topic’s importance.
He also
reports that the view about liberty that he presented in the
first edition came to seem to him wrong, and expresses
some pride in his willingness to admit to his errors and to
correct them.
In the remainder of the section he returns to
something he said in section 4, namely that when bodies
move their movement is given to them by other bodies,
so that this is _passive_ rather than _active_ power.
He now
remarks that many mental events exhibit passive rather than
active power, for example when the mind acquires an idea
‘from the operation of an external substance’.
He concludes:]
This reflection may be of some use to preserve us from
mistakes about powers and actions that we can be led into
by grammar and the common structure of languages—the
point being that grammatically ‘active’ verbs don’t always
signify action.
When for example I _see_ the moon or _feel_ the
heat of the sun, the verbs are active but what they report
is no action by me but only the passive reception of ideas
from external bodies.
On the other hand, when I _turn_ my
eyes another way, or _move_ my body out of the sunbeams, I


am genuinely active, because I put myself into that motion
of my own choice, by a power within myself.
Such an action
is the product of active power.


**73.** So now I have presented in compact form [chapters ii-xxi]
a view of our original [here = ‘basic’] ideas, out of which all the
rest are made up.
I believe that hard philosophical work
would show that all our ideas come down to these very few
primary and original ones:

extension
solidity
mobility, or the power of being moved.
We get these ideas from bodies, through our senses.
Also
(coining two new words, which I think will be useful):

perceptivity, or the power of perception or thinking
motivity, or the power of moving.
We get these from our own minds, through reflection.
When
we add

existence
duration
number



which come to us through sensation and reflection, we may
have completed the list of original ideas on which the rest
depend.
For I think that these would suffice to explain the
nature of colours, sounds, tastes, smells, and all our other
ideas, if only we had faculties acute enough to perceive the
textures and movements of the minute bodies that produce
in us those sensations ·of colour, taste, and so on·.
But it is
no part of my purpose in this book to investigate scientifically
the textures and structures of bodies through which they
have the power to produce in us the ideas of their sensible
qualities.
For my purposes it is enough to note that gold or
saffron has a power to produce in us the idea of yellow, and
snow or milk the idea of white, which we can only have by our
sight; I needn’t explore the physics of what gives them those
powers.
Though ·I’ll say just this about the causes of those
powers·: when we go beyond the bare ideas in our minds and
start to think about their causes, we can’t conceive anything
in a sensible object through which it could produce different
ideas in us except the sizes, shapes, numbers, textures, and
motions of its imperceptible parts.


# **Chapter xxii: Mixed modes**



**1.** In the foregoing chapters ·xiii–xxi· I have discussed
_simple modes_, showing through examples of some of the
most important of them what they are and how we come
by them.
Now I am ready to consider the ideas that we call
_mixed modes_ .
Examples are the complex ideas of _obligation_,
_drunkenness_, a _lie_, etc., which I call mixed modes because



they consist of combinations of simple ideas of different
kinds, unlike the more simple modes, which consist of
simple ideas all of the same kind.
These mixed modes are
distinguished from the complex ideas of _substances_ by the
fact that they are not looked upon to be typical marks of
any real beings that have a steady existence, and are only


scattered and independent ideas put together by the mind.


**2.** Experience shows us that the mind gets its simple ideas
in a wholly passive manner, receiving them all from the existence and operations of things presented to us by sensation
and reflection; we can’t make such an idea for ourselves.
But
mixed modes—our present topic—are quite different in their
origin.
The mind often exercises an active power in making
these several combinations: once it has some simple ideas,
it can assemble them into various complexes, thus making
a variety of complex ideas, without examining whether they
exist together in that way in nature.
I think that is why
these ideas are called _notions_, implying that they have their
origin and their constant existence more in the thoughts
of men than in the reality of things.
To form such ideas
it sufficed that the mind puts the parts of them together,
and that they were consistent in the understanding, without
considering whether they had any real being; though I don’t
deny that some of them might be taken from observation.
The man who first formed the idea of _hypocrisy_ might either
have •taken it at first from observing someone who made
a show of good qualities that he didn’t really have, or else
have •formed that idea in his mind without having any such
pattern to fashion it by. ·There must be cases of the latter
sort·.
For it is evident that in the beginning of languages and
societies of men, some of their complex ideas. . . .must have
been in men’s minds before they existed anywhere else; and
that many names standing for such complex ideas were in
use before the combinations they stood for ever existed.


**3.** Now that we have languages that abound with words
standing for such combinations, one common way of acquiring these complex ideas is through _explanations_ of ·the
meanings of· the terms that stand for them.
Because such
an idea consists of a number of simple ideas combined,



the words standing for those simple ideas can be used to
explain what the complex one is.
This procedure requires
only that the pupil understand those names for simple ideas;
he needn’t ever have encountered this particular combination
of them in the real world.
In this way a man can come to have
the idea of _sacrilege_ or _murder_ without ever seeing either of
them committed.


**4.** What gives a mixed mode its unity?
How do precisely
_these_ simple ideas come to make a single complex idea?
In
some cases the combination doesn’t exist in nature, so _that_
can’t be the source of the idea’s unity.
I answer that the idea
gets its unity from _the mind’s act_ of combining those simple
ideas and considering them as one complex idea of which
those are the parts; and the giving of a name to the complex
idea is generally viewed as the final stage in the process
of combination.
For men seldom think of any collection of
simple ideas as making one complex one unless they have a
name for it.
Thus, though _the killing of an old man_ is as fit
in nature to be united into one complex idea as _the killing of_
_one’s father_, because the former has no name (comparable
with ‘parricide’ for the latter) it isn’t taken for a particular
complex idea. . . .


**5.** Of all the combinations of simple ideas that are, in the
nature of things, fit to be brought together into complex
ideas, men select some for that treatment and neglect others.
Why?
The answer lies in the purposes for which men have
language.
The purpose of language is for men to show their
thoughts, or to communicate them to one another, as quickly
as possible; so men usually make _and name_ the complex
modes for which they have frequent use in everyday life and
conversation; and ones that they seldom have occasion to
mention they leave loose, without names to tie them together.
When they _do_ need to speak of one of these combinations,


they can do so through the names of their constituent simple
ideas.
The alternative is to trouble their memories with the
burden of too many complex ideas that they seldom or never
have any occasion to make use of.


[In sections **6–7** Locke gets two explanations out of his
view that complex-idea words are coined when _needed_ .
It
explains, he says in section 6, why every culture has words
that aren’t strictly translatable into the language of others;
and (in section 7) why within a single language the meanings
of words constantly change.
He then returns to his main
theme:] If you want to see how many different ideas are in
this way wrapped up in one short sound, and how much
of our time and breath is thereby saved, try to list all the
·simple· ideas that are involved in the meaning of ‘reprieve’
or ‘appeal’!


**8.** Mixed modes are fleeting and transient combinations of
simple ideas; they have a short existence everywhere except
in the minds of men, and even there they exist only while
they are thought of; their greatest permanency is in their
_names_, which are therefore apt to be taken for the ideas
themselves.
If we ask where the idea of a _triumph_ . . . .exists,
it is evident this collection of ideas could not exist all together
anywhere in the thing itself, for a triumph is an action that
stretches through time, so that its constituents could never
all exist together. [Locke is using ‘triumph’ in its sense of ‘victory

parade’.] This will be dealt with more extensively when I come
to treat of words and their use ·in Book III·, but I couldn’t
avoid saying this much at the present stage.


**9.** So there are three ways in which one can acquire a complex idea of a mixed mode. •By experience and observation
of things themselves: by seeing men wrestle, we get the idea
of _wrestling_ . •By invention, putting together several simple
ideas in our own minds: he that first invented _printing_ had



an idea of it in his mind before it ever existed.
The most
usual way, •by explaining the names of actions we never
saw or notions we can’t see, enumerating all the ideas that
are their constituent parts. . . .
All our complex ideas are
ultimately resolvable into simple ideas out of which they are
built up, though their immediate ingredients (so to speak)
may also be complex ideas.
The mixed mode that the word
‘lie’ stands for is made of these simple ideas:

•Articulate sounds.
•Certain ideas in the mind of the speaker.
•Those words the signs of those ideas.
•Those signs put together by affirmation or negation,
otherwise than the ideas they stand for are ·related·
in the mind of the speaker.

I don’t think I need to go any further in the analysis of that
complex idea we call a _lie_ .
What I have said is enough to show
that it is made up of simple ideas, and it would be tedious to
enumerate every particular simple idea that goes into this
complex one. . . .
All our complex ideas. . . .can ultimately
be resolved ·or analysed· into simple ideas, which are the
only materials of knowledge or thought that we have or can
have.
There is no reason to fear that this restricts the mind
to too scanty a supply of ideas: think what an inexhaustible
stock of •simple modes we get from _number_ and _shape_ alone!
So we can easily imagine how far from scanty our supply
of •mixed modes is, since they are made from the various
combinations of different simple ideas and of their infinite
modes. . . .


**10.** The simple ideas that have been most modified, and
had most mixed ideas (with corresponding names) made out
of them are these three: _thinking_ and _motion_ (which cover
all action) and _power_ (from which these actions are thought
to flow).
Action is the great business of mankind, and the


whole subject-matter of all laws; so it is no wonder that all
sorts of modes of thinking and motion should be attended
to, their ideas observed and laid up in the memory, and
names assigned to them.
Without all this, laws could not be
well made, or vice and disorders repressed.
Nor could men
communicate well with one another if they didn’t have such
complex ideas with names attached to them.
So men have
equipped themselves with settled names, and supposedly settled ideas in their minds, of kinds of •actions distinguished
by their causes, means, objects, ends, instruments, time,
place, and other circumstances, and also of their •powers
to perform those actions.
For example, _boldness_ is the
•power to speak or do what we want, publicly, without fear
or disorder. . . .
When a man has acquired a power or ability
to do something through doing it frequently, we call that a
‘habit’; when he has a power that he is ready to exercise at
the drop of a hat, we call it a ‘disposition’.
Thus ·for example·
_testiness_ is a disposition or aptness to be angry.
Summing
up: Let us examine any modes of action, for example

•consideration and assent, which are actions of the
mind,
•running and speaking, which are actions of the body,
•revenge and murder, which are actions of both together;
and we shall find them to be merely collections of simple
ideas that together make up the complex ideas signified by
those names.


**11.** Power is the source of all action; and the substances
that _have_ the powers, when they exert a power to produce



an act, are called _causes_ ; and what comes about by the
exerting of that power—a substance that is produced, or
simple ideas [here = ‘qualities’] that are introduced into any
subject—are called _effects_ .
The efficacy through which the
new substance or idea is produced is called _action_ in the
subject that exerts the power, and _passion_ in the subject in
which any simple idea is changed or produced.
Although this
efficacy takes many forms, I think that in thinking beings it
is conceivable only as modes of •thinking and •willing, and
in bodies only as modifications of •motion.
If there is any
kind of action other than these, I have no notion or idea of
it; and so it is far from my thoughts, apprehensions, and
knowledge, and I am as much in the dark about it as I am
about five extra senses or as a blind man is about colours.
Many words that _seem_ to express some action, really signify
nothing of the action—nothing of the _how_ of it—but merely
the effect together with some facts about •the thing that
causes or •the thing upon which the cause operates.
Thus,
for example, _creation_ and _annihilation_ contain in them no
idea of the action or how it is produced, but merely of the
cause and the thing done.
Similarly, when a peasant says
‘Cold freezes water’, although the word ‘freeze’ seems to
import some ·specific kind of· action, all it really means ·in
the mouth of the peasant· is that water that was fluid has
become hard, implying no idea of the action through which
this is done.


[In section **12** Locke remarks that his purpose has been to
show how words with complex meanings can be defined, not
actually to define them all.]


# **Chapter xxiii: Complex ideas of substances**



**1.** The mind is supplied with many simple ideas, which
come to it through the senses from outer things or through
reflection on its own activities.
Sometimes it notices that a
certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together,
and it presumes them to belong to _one thing_ ; and—because
words are suited to ordinary ways of thinking and are used
for speed and convenience—those ideas when united in one
subject are called by _one name_ .
Then we carelessly talk as
though we had here one simple idea, though really it is a
complication of many ideas together.
What has happened
in such a case is that, because we can’t imagine how these
simple ideas could exist by themselves, we have acquired
the habit of assuming that they exist in (and result from)
some substratum, which we call _substance_ . [‘Substratum’ =


‘what underlies’ = something that serves as the _basis_ or _foundation_ of

something else.]


**2.** So that if you examine your notion of _pure substance in_
_general_, you’ll find that your only idea of it is a supposition of
_an unknown support of qualities_ that are able to cause simple
ideas in us—qualities that are commonly called ‘accidents’.
If anyone were asked •‘What is the subject in which colour or
weight inheres?’, he would have to reply ‘In the solid extended
parts’; and if he were asked •‘What does that solidity and
extension inhere in?’, he wouldn’t be in a much better
position than the Indian philosopher who said that the world
was supported by a great elephant, and when asked what the
elephant rested on answered ‘A great tortoise’.
Being further
pressed to know what supported the broad-backed tortoise,
he replied that it was _something he knew not what_ .
So too
here, as in all cases where we use words without having
clear and distinct ideas, we talk like children who, being



asked ‘What’s _this_ ?’ about something they don’t recognize,
cheerfully answer ‘It’s a _thing_ ’.
Really all this means, when
said by either children or adults, is that they don’t know
what it is, and that ‘the thing’ they purport to know and talk
about isn’t something of which they have any distinct idea at
all—they are indeed perfectly in the dark about it.
So the idea
of ours to which we give the general name ‘substance’, being
nothing but the supposed but unknown support of those
qualities we find existing and which we imagine can’t exist
‘ _sine re substante_ ’—that is, without some thing to support
them—we call that support _substantia_ ; which, according to
the true meaning of the word, is in plain English _standing_
_under_ or upholding. [‘Sub’ is Latin for ‘under’, and ‘stans’ is Latin for


‘standing’; so ‘substans’ (English ‘substance’) literally means something

that stands under something.]


**3.** In this way we form an obscure and relative idea of
substance in general. ·It is _relative_ because it isn’t an
idea of what substance is like in itself, but only an idea
of how it •relates to something else, namely the qualities
that it •upholds or stands under·.
From this we move on to
having ideas of various sorts of substances, which we form by
collecting combinations of simple ideas that we find in our experience tend to go together and which we therefore suppose
to flow from the particular internal constitution or unknown
essence of a substance.
Thus we come to have the ideas of a
_man_, _horse_, _gold_, _water_, etc.
If you look into yourself, you’ll
find that your only clear idea of these sorts of substances is
the idea of certain simple ideas existing together.
It is the
combination of ordinary qualities observable in _iron_, or a
_diamond_, that makes the true complex idea of those kinds
of substances—kinds that a smith or a jeweller commonly


knows better than a philosopher does.
Whatever technical
use he may make of the term ‘substance’, the philosopher
or scientist has no idea of _iron_ or _diamond_ except what is
provided by a collection of the simple ideas that are to be
found in them—with •one further ingredient. complex ideas
of substances are made up of those simple ideas plus •the
confused idea of some _thing_ to which they belong and in
which they exist.
So when we speak of any sort of substance,
we say it is a thing having such or such qualities: body is
a thing that is extended, shaped, and capable of motion;
•spirit, a thing that can think; and we say that hardness and
power to attract iron are qualities to be found _in_ a loadstone,
·conceived of as a _thing_ containing these qualities·. [Loadstone

is a kind of rock that is naturally magnetic.] These and similar ways
of speaking show that the substance is always thought of
as some thing in addition to the extension, shape, solidity,
motion, thinking, or other observable ideas, though we don’t
know what it is. [Locke uses •‘spirit’, as he does ‘soul’, to mean merely


‘thing that thinks’ or ‘thing that has mental properties’.
It doesn’t mean

something _spiritual_ in any current sense of the term.]


**4.** So when we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal
substances—e.g. horse, stone, etc.—although our idea of it
is nothing but the collection of simple ideas of qualities that
we usually find united in the thing called ‘horse’ or ‘stone’,
still we think of these qualities as existing in and supported
by some common subject; and we give this support the
name ‘substance’, though we have no clear or distinct idea of
what it is.
We are led to think in this way because we can’t
conceive how qualities could exist unsupported or with only
one another for support.


**5.** The same thing happens concerning the operations of the
mind—thinking, reasoning, fearing, etc.
These can’t exist by
themselves, we think, nor can we see how they could belong



to body or be produced by it; so we are apt to think that
they are the actions of some other substance, which we call
‘spirit’.
We have as clear a notion of the substance of •spirit
as we have of •body.
The latter is supposed (without knowing
what it is) to be •the substratum of those simple ideas that
come to us from the outside, and the former is supposed
(still not knowing what it is) to be •the substratum of the
mental operations we experience within ourselves.
Clearly,
then, we have as poor a grasp of the idea of bodily substance
as we have of spiritual substance or spirit.
So we shouldn’t
infer that there is no such thing as spirit because we have no
notion of the substance of spirit, any more than we should
conclude that there is no such thing as body because we
have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of matter.


**6.** Whatever the secret, abstract nature of substance in
general may be, therefore, all our ideas of particular sorts
of substances are nothing but combinations of simple ideas
co-existing in some unknown cause of their union.
We
represent particular sorts of substances to ourselves through
such combinations of simple ideas, and in no other way.
They are the only ideas we have of the various sorts of
things—the sorts that we signify to other people by means
of such names as ‘man’, ‘horse’, ‘sun’, ‘water’, ‘iron’.
Anyone
who hears such a word, and understands the language,
forms in his mind a combination of those simple ideas that
he has found—or thinks he has found—to exist together
under that name; all of which he supposes to rest in and be
fixed to that unknown common subject that doesn’t inhere
in anything else in its turn.
Consider for instance the idea of
the sun: it is merely a collection of the simple ideas, bright,
hot, roundish, having a constant regular motion, at a certain
distance from us—and perhaps a few others, depending
on how accurately the owner of the idea has observed the


properties of the sun.


**7.** The most perfect idea of any particular sort of substance
results from putting together most of the simple ideas that
do exist in it—·i.e. in substances of that sort·—including its
active powers and passive capacities. (These are not simple
ideas, but for brevity’s sake let us here pretend that they
are.) Thus the complex idea of the substance that we call
_a loadstone_ has as a part _the power of attracting iron_ ; and _a_
_power to be attracted by a loadstone_ is a part of the complex
idea we call ‘iron’.
These _powers_ are counted as inherent
_qualities_ of the things that have them.
Every substance is
as likely, through the powers we observe in it, (a) to change
the perceptible qualities of other subjects as (b) to produce
in us those simple ideas that we receive _immediately_ from
it.
When (b) happens with fire (say), our senses perceive
in fire its heat and colour, which are really only the fire’s
powers to produce those ideas in us.
When (a) happens,
we also learn about the fire because it acts on us _mediately_

[= ‘through an intermediary’] by turning wood into charcoal and
thereby altering how _the wood_ affects our senses. . . .
In what
follows, I shall sometimes include these powers among the
simple ideas that we gather together in our minds when we
think of particular substances.
Of course they aren’t really
_simple;_ but they are _simpler_ than the complex ideas of kinds
of substance, of which they are merely parts.


**8.** It isn’t surprising that powers loom large in our complex
ideas of substances.
We mostly distinguish substances one
from another through their secondary qualities, which make
a large part of our complex ideas of substances . (Our senses
will not let us learn the sizes, textures, and shapes of the
minute parts of bodies on which their real constitutions and
differences depend; so we are thrown back on using their
secondary qualities as bases for distinguishing them one



from another.) And all the secondary qualities, as has been
shown ·in viii·, are nothing but powers. . . .


**9.** The ideas that make our complex ideas of bodily substances are of three sorts.
First, the ideas of the _primary_
_qualities_ of things, including the size, shape, number, position, and motion of the parts of bodies.
We discover these
by our senses, but they are in the bodies even when we
don’t perceive them.
Secondly, the sensible [= ‘perceptible’]
_secondary qualities_ .
They depend on the primary qualities,
and are nothing but the powers that bodies have to produce
certain ideas in us through our senses.
These ideas are not
in the things themselves except in the sense that a thing is
‘in’ its cause.
Thirdly, when we think that one substance
can cause an alteration in the primary qualities of another,
so that the altered substance would produce in us different
ideas from what it did before, we speak of the active _powers_
of the first substance and the passive _powers_ of the second.
We know about the powers of things only through sensible
simple ideas.
For example, whatever alteration a loadstone
has the power to make in the minute particles of iron, we
wouldn’t suspect that it had _any_ power to affect iron if that
power weren’t revealed by how the loadstone makes the iron
particles move.
I have no doubt that bodies that we handle
every day have powers to cause thousands of changes in one
another—powers that we never suspect because they never
appear in sensible effects.


**10.** So it is proper that powers should loom large in our
complex ideas of substances.
If you examine your complex
idea of _gold_, you’ll find that several of the ideas that make
it up are only ·ideas of· powers.
For example, the power of
being melted without being burned away, and the power of
being dissolved in aqua regia [a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric

acids]—these ideas are as essential to our complex idea of


gold as are its colour and weight.
Indeed, colour and weight
when properly understood turn out also to be nothing but
powers.
For yellowness is not actually in gold, but is a power
that gold has, when placed in proper light, to produce a
certain idea in us through our eyes.
Similarly, the heat
that we can’t leave out of our idea of the sun is no more
really in the sun than is the white colour it gives to wax.
These are both equally powers in the sun, which operates
on a man—through the motion and shape of its sensible
parts—so as to make him have the idea of heat; just as it
operates on wax so as to make it capable of producing in a
man the idea of white.


**11.** If our senses were sharp enough to distinguish the
minute particles of bodies and the real constitution on which
their sensible qualities depend, I am sure they would produce
in us ideas quite different from the ones they now produce;
the yellow colour of gold, for example, would be replaced by
an admirable texture of parts of a certain size and shape.
Microscopes plainly tell us this; for what to our naked eyes
produces a certain colour is revealed through a microscope
to be quite different.
Thus sand or ground glass, which is
opaque and white to the naked eye, is transparent under a
microscope; and a hair seen this way loses its former colour
and is mostly transparent, with a mixture of bright sparkling
colours like the ones refracted from a diamond.
Blood to
the naked eye appears all red; but when its lesser parts
are brought into view by a good microscope, it turns out to
be a clear liquid with a few red globules floating in it.
We
don’t know how these red globules would appear if glasses
could be found that would magnify them a thousand or ten
thousand times more.


**12.** God in his infinite wisdom has given us senses, faculties,
and organs that are suitable for the conveniences of life



and for the business we have to do here. senses enable us
to know and distinguish things, and to examine them in
enough detail to be able to make use of them and in various
ways accommodate them to our daily needs. insight into
their admirable structures and wonderful effects goes far
enough for us to admire and praise the wisdom, power, and
goodness of their author. . . .
But it seems that God didn’t
intend that we should have a perfect, clear, and adequate
knowledge of things; and perhaps no finite being _can_ have
such knowledge. faculties, dull and weak as they are, suffice
for us to discover enough in created things to lead us to •the
knowledge of the creator, and •the knowledge of our duty;
and we are also equipped with enough abilities to •provide
for the conveniences of living.
These are our business in
this world.
But if our senses were made much keener and
more acute, the surface appearances of things would be
quite different for us, and, I’m inclined to think that this
would be inconsistent with our survival—or at least with our
well-being—in this part of the universe that we inhabit.
Think
about how little we are fitted to survive being moved into air
not much higher than the air we commonly breathe—that
will give you reason to be satisfied that on this planet that
has been assigned as our home God has suited our organs
to the bodies that are to affect them, and vice versa.
If our
sense of hearing were merely one thousand times more acute
than it is, how distracted we would be by perpetual noise!
Even in the quietest retirement we would be less able to sleep
or meditate than we are now in the middle of a sea-battle.
If someone’s eyesight (the most instructive of our senses)
were a thousand or a hundred thousand times more acute
than it is now through the best microscope, he would be
able to see with his naked eyes things several million times
smaller than the smallest object he can see now; ·and this
would have •a good result and •a bad one·. •It would bring


him nearer to discovering the texture and motion of the
minute parts of corporeal things, and he would probably get
ideas of the internal structures of many of them.
But then
•he would be in a quite different world from other people:
nothing would appear the same to him as to others; the
visible ideas of everything would be different.
So that I don’t
think that he could converse with others concerning the
objects of sight, or communicate in any way about colours,
their appearances being so wholly different. [The section
continues with further remarks about the disadvantages of
having ‘such microscopical eyes (if I may so call them)’.
It
ends thus:] Someone who was sharp-sighted enough to see
the arrangement of the minute particles of the spring of a
clock, and observe the special structure and ways of moving
on which its elastic motion depends, would no doubt discover
something very admirable.
But if his eyes were so formed
that he couldn’t _tell the time_ by his clock, because he couldn’t
from a distance take in all at once the clock-hand and
the numerals on the dial, he wouldn’t get much advantage
from the acuteness of his sight: it would let him in on the
structure and workings of the parts of the machine while
also making it useless to him!


[In section **13** —an admitted interruption of the main line
of thought—Locke remarks that the structure of our sense
organs is what sets limits to what we can perceive in the
material world, and offers his ‘extravagant conjecture’ about
‘Spirits’, here meaning something like ‘angels’.
Assuming
that they ‘sometimes’ have bodies, angels may be able to
alter their sense organs at will, thus being able to perceive
many things that we can’t.
Locke can’t hide his envy about
this, though he says that ‘no doubt’ God has good reasons
for giving us sense-organs that we cannot flex at will, like
muscles.]



**14.** Each of our ideas of a specific kind of substances
is nothing but a collection of simple ideas considered as
united in one thing.
These ideas of substances, though they
strike us as simple and have simple words as names, are
nevertheless really complex and compounded.
Thus the idea
that an Englishman signifies by the name ‘swan’, is white
colour, long neck, red beak, black legs, and webbed feet,
and all these of a certain size, with a power of swimming in
the water, and making a certain kind of noise—and perhaps
other properties as well, for someone who knows a lot about
this kind of bird—all united in one common subject.


**15.** Besides the complex ideas we have of •material sensible substances, we can also form the complex idea of an
•immaterial spirit.
We get this through the simple ideas
we have taken from operations of our own minds that we
experience daily in ourselves, such as


thinking
understanding
willing
knowing, and
power of beginning motion, etc.

all co-existing in some substance.
By putting these ideas
together, we have as clear a perception and notion of immaterial substances as we have of material ones.
For putting
together the ideas of •thinking and •willing and •the power
of starting or stopping bodily motion, joined to _substance_,
of which we have no distinct idea, we have the idea of an
•immaterial spirit; and by putting together the ideas of •solid
parts that hold together, and •a power of being moved, joined
with _substance_, of which likewise we have no positive idea,
we have the idea of •matter. [Here ‘positive’ contrasts with ‘relative’.


The _idea of substance in general_ is relative because it is only the idea of

whatever-it-is that relates to qualities by upholding and uniting them.]


The one is as clear and distinct an idea as the other, the ideas
of thinking and moving a body being as clear and distinct
as the ideas of extension, solidity, and being moved.
For
our idea of substance is equally obscure, or none at all, in
both: It is merely a supposed _I know not what_, to support
qualities.
Those who believe that our senses show us nothing
but material things haven’t thought hard enough!
When you
think about it, you’ll realize that every act of sensation gives
us an equal view of both parts of nature, the corporeal and
the spiritual [= ‘the bodily and the mental’].
For while I know by
seeing or hearing etc. that there is some bodily thing outside
me that is the object of that sensation, I know with even
more certainty that there is some spiritual being within me
that sees and hears.
This seeing and hearing can’t be done
by mere senseless matter; it couldn’t occur except as the
action of an immaterial thinking being.


**16.** All that we know of body is contained in our complex
idea of it as extended, shaped, coloured, and having other
sensible qualities; and all this is as far from the idea of the
substance of body as we would be if we knew nothing at all.
And although we think we are very familiar with matter, and
know a great deal about many of its qualities, it may turn
out that our basic ideas of •body are no more numerous, and
no clearer, than our basic ideas of •immaterial spirit.


**17.** The basic ideas that we have that apply to body and not
to spirit are •the holding together of parts that are solid and
therefore separable, and •a power of causing things to move
by colliding with them.
Bodies also have shapes, but shape
is merely a consequence of finite extension.


**18.** The ideas we have belonging exclusively to spirit are
•thinking and •will (which is the power of putting body into
motion by thought) and •liberty.
Whereas a body can’t help
setting in motion a motionless body with which it collides,



the mind is at liberty to put bodies into motion or refrain from
doing so, as it pleases.
The ideas of •existence, •duration,
and •mobility are common to both body and spirit.


**19.** It shouldn’t be thought strange that I attribute mobility
to spirit.
Spirits, like bodies can only operate _where they_
_are_ ; we find that a single spirit operates at different times
in different places; so I have to attribute _change of place_ to
all finite spirits (I’m not speaking of ·God·, the infinite spirit,
here).
For my soul [= ‘spirit’ = ‘mind’] is a real thing just as
much as my body is, and is equally capable of changing its
distance from any other ·spatially located· being; and so it is
capable of motion. . . .


**20.** Everyone finds in himself that his soul •can think, will,
and operate on his body in the place where that body is,
but •cannot operate on a body or in a place a hundred
miles away.
You can’t imagine that your soul could think
or move a body in Oxford while you are in London, and you
have to realize that your soul, being united to your body,
continually changes its location during the whole journey
between Oxford and London, just as does the coach or horse
that you ride on—so I think it can be said to be truly _in_
_motion_ throughout that journey.
If that isn’t conceded as
giving a clear idea enough of the soul’s motion, you will get
one from ·the thought of· its being separated from the body
in death; for it seems to impossible that you should think of
it as •leaving the body while having no idea of •its motion.


[In section **21** Locke discusses a scholastic reason for denying that souls or spirits can move, and derisively challenges
its supporters ‘to put it into intelligible English’.
He concludes:] Indeed motion cannot be attributed to God—not
because he is an immaterial spirit but because he is an
infinite one.


**22.** Let us compare our complex idea of _immaterial spirit_
with our complex idea of _body_, and see whether one is more
obscure than the other—and if so, which. idea of body, I
think, is ·that of·

_an extended solid substance, capable of transferring_
_motion by impact_ ;
and our idea of soul or immaterial spirit is ·the idea· of

_a substance that thinks, and has a power of making a_
_body move, by willing or thought_ .
Which of these is more obscure and harder to grasp?
I
know that people whose thoughts are immersed in matter,
and have so subjected their minds to their senses that they
seldom reflect on anything that their senses can’t reach,
are apt to say that they can’t comprehend a _thinking thing_ .
Perhaps they can’t, but then if they think hard about it they’ll
realize that they can’t comprehend an _extended thing_ either.


**23.** If anyone says ‘I don’t know what it is that thinks in
me’, he means that he doesn’t know what the substance
is of that thinking thing.
I respond that he has no better
grasp of what the substance is of that solid thing.
If he
also says ‘I don’t know _how_ I think’, I respond that he also
doesn’t know _how_ he is extended—that is, how the solid
parts of body cohere together to make extension. ·I shall
discuss the cohesion problem—the problem of explaining
how portions of matter hang together to compose planets or
pebbles or grains of sand—from here through to the end of
section 27·.
The pressure of the particles of air may account
for the cohesion of some parts of matter that are bigger than
the particles of air and have pores that are smaller than
those particles; but that can’t explain the coherence of the
particles of air themselves.
Whatever holds _them_ together,
it isn’t the pressure of the air!
And if the pressure of any
matter that is finer than the air—such as the _ether_ —can



unite and hold together the parts of a particle of air (as well
as of other bodies), it still can’t make bonds _for itself_ and
hold together the parts that make up every least particle
of that _materia subtilis_ [= ‘extra-fine matter’].
Thus, however
ingeniously we develop our explanation of how the parts of
perceptible bodies are held together by the pressure of other
imperceptible bodies ·such as the particles of the ether·, that
explanation doesn’t extend to the parts of the ether itself.
The more success we have in showing that the parts of other
bodies are held together by the external pressure of the ether,
and can have no other conceivable cause of their cohesion
and union, the more completely we are left in the dark about
what holds together the _parts of each particle_ of the ether
itself.
We •can’t conceive of those particles as not having
parts, because they are bodies, and thus divisible; but we
also •can’t conceive of how their parts cohere, because the
explanation of how _everything else_ coheres cannot be applied
to _them_ .


**24.** ·The foregoing argument shows that even if pressure
from the ether • _could_ explain the cohesion of most bodies,
it leaves unexplained the cohesion of the particles of the
ether itself·.
But in fact pressure, however great, from a
surrounding fluid ·such as the ether· •cannot be what causes
the cohesion of the solid parts of matter.
Such a pressure
might prevent two things with polished surfaces from moving
apart in a line •perpendicular to those surfaces,. . . .but it
can’t even slightly hinder their pulling apart in a line •parallel
to those surfaces—·I shall call this a ‘lateral motion’·.
The
surrounding fluid is free to occupy each part of space that is
deserted through such a lateral motion; so it doesn’t resist
such a motion of bodies joined in that way, any more than
it would resist the motion of a body that was surrounded
on all sides by that fluid and didn’t touch any other body.


And therefore, if there were no other cause of cohesion ·than
this surrounding-fluid one·, all parts of ·all· bodies would be
easily separable by such a lateral sliding motion.
So it is no
harder for us to have a clear idea of how the soul thinks than
to have one of how body is extended.
For the •extendedness
of body consists in nothing but the •union and cohesion of
its solid parts, so we shall have a poor grasp of the extension
of body when we don’t understand the union and cohesion
of its parts; and we _don’t_ understand that, any more than
we understand what thinking is and how it is performed.


**25.** Most people would wonder how anyone should see a
difficulty in what they think they observe every day. ‘Don’t
we see the parts of bodies stick firmly together?
Is there
anything more common?
And what doubt can there be made
of it?’ And similarly with regard to thinking and voluntary
motion: ‘Don’t we experience it every moment in ourselves?
So can it be doubted?’ The matter of fact is clear, I agree,
but when we want to look more closely and think about _how_
it is done, we are at a loss both about extension and about
thought. . . .


**26.** The little bodies that compose the fluid we call ‘water’
are so extremely small that I have never heard of anyone
claiming to see their distinct size, shape, or motion through
a microscope (and I’ve heard of microscopes that have magnified up to a hundred thousand times, and more).
And the
particles of water are also so perfectly loose one from another
that the least force perceptibly separates them.
Indeed, if
we think about their perpetual motion we must accept that
they _don’t_ cohere with another; and when a sharp cold
comes they unite, they consolidate, these little atoms cohere,
and they can’t be separated without great force.
Something
we don’t yet know—and it would be a great discovery—is
what the bonds are that tie these heaps of loose little bodies



together so firmly, what the cement is that sticks them
so tightly together ·in ice·.
But someone who made that
discovery would still be long way from ·solving the _general_
problem·, making intelligible the extension of body (which
is the cohesion of its solid parts).
For _that_ he would need
to show how the parts of those bonds—or of that cement,
or of the least particle of matter that exists—hold together.
It seems, then, that this primary and supposedly obvious
quality of body, ·extension·, turns out when examined to be
as incomprehensible as anything belonging to our minds,
and that it is as hard to conceive a solid extended substance
as it is to conceive a thinking immaterial one. . . .


**27.** Here is a further difficulty about solving the cohesion
problem through an appeal to surrounding pressures.
Let
us suppose that matter is finite (as no doubt it is).
Now
think about the outermost bounds of the universe, and ask
yourself:

What conceivable hoops, what bond, can hold _this_
_unified mass of matter_ together with a pressure from
which steel must get its strength and diamonds their
hardness and indissolubility?
If matter is finite, it must have boundaries, and there must
be something that stops it from scattering in all directions.
If
you try to avoid this ·latest· difficulty by supposing that the
material world is _infinite_ in extent, ask yourself what light
you are throwing on the cohesion of body—whether you are
making it more intelligible by relying on the most absurd
and incomprehensible of all suppositions.
So far is our ·idea
of· the extension of body (which is nothing but the cohesion
of solid parts) from being clearer or more distinct when we
enquire into the nature, cause, or manner of it, than is the
idea of thinking!


**28.** Another idea that we have of body is ·the idea of· the
_power of transferring motion by impact_ : and of our souls ·the
idea of· _the power of exciting motion by thought_ .
Everyday
experience clearly provides us with these two ideas, but here
again if we enquire how each power is exercised, we are
equally in the dark.
In the most usual case of motion’s being
communicated from one body to another through impact,
the former body loses as much motion as the other acquires;
and the only conception we have of what is going on here
is that _motion passes out of one body into the other_ .
That
seems to me to be as obscure and inconceivable as how
our minds move or stop our bodies by thought, which we
every moment find they do.
Daily experience provides us
with clear evidence of motion produced by impact, and of
motion produced by thought; but as for _how_ this is done,
we are equally at a loss with both.
So that when we think
about •the communication of motion, whether by body or by
spirit, •the idea of it that is involved in spirit-as-mover is at
least as clear as •the one involved in body-as-mover.
And if
we consider the _active power of moving_ (called ‘motivity’ ·in
xxi.73·), it is much clearer in spirit than body.
Place two
bodies at rest side by side; they give us no idea of a power in
the one to move the other, except through a borrowed motion.
The mind, on the other hand, every day gives us ideas of
an active power of moving bodies.
This gives us reason to
think that active power may be the proper [here = ‘exclusive’]
attribute of spirits, and passive power the proper attribute
of matter.
If that is so, then created spirits are not totally
other than matter, because as well as being active (as matter
isn’t) they are also passive (as matter is).
Pure spirit, namely
God, is only active; pure matter is only passive; and beings
·like us· that are both active and passive may be judged to
involve both. . . .



**29.** In conclusion: Sensation convinces us that there are
•solid extended substances, and reflection that there are
•thinking ones.
Experience assures us that •one has a
power to move body by impact, •the other by thought.
That
much is sure, and we have clear ideas of it; but we can’t
go any further.
If we start asking about nature, causes,
and manner ·of operation·, we see no more clearly into the
nature of extension than we do into the nature of thinking.
It is no harder to conceive how a substance that we don’t
know should •by thought set body into motion, than how a
substance that we don’t know should •by impact set body
into motion. . . .


[In sections **30–31** Locke sums up the results of the last
few sections, re-emphasizing that the idea of a thinking
substance is not less respectable than that of an extended
substance.
He concludes section 31 with a new difficulty
about the latter:] Nothing in our notion of spirit is more
perplexed, or nearer a contradiction, than something that the
very notion of body includes in it, namely the _infinite divisi-_
_bility_ of any finite extended thing.
Whether we accept this or
reject it, we land ourselves in consequences that we can’t explain or make consistent within our thought—consequences
that carry greater difficulty, and more apparent absurdity,
than anything that follows from the notion of an immaterial
knowing substance.


[In section **32** Locke starts by rehearsing the arguments
he has given for the view that ‘we have as much reason
to be satisfied with our notion of immaterial spirit as with
our notion of body, and of the existence of the one as well
as of the other’.
He then launches, without announcing
that he is doing so, into a new issue: is a human being
an extended thing that thinks, or rather a pair of things
of which one is extended and the other thinks?] It is no


more a contradiction that •thinking should exist separate
and independent from solidity than that •solidity should
exist separate and independent from thinking.
Thought and
extension are simple ideas, independent one from another;
and we are as entitled to allow •a thinking thing without
solidity as we are •a solid thing without thinking.
It may be
hard to conceive how thinking could occur without matter,
but it’s at least as hard to conceive how matter could think.
Whenever we try to get beyond our simple ideas, to dive
deeper into the nature of things, we immediately fall into
darkness and obscurity, perplexity and difficulties.
But
whichever of these complex ideas is clearer, that of body
or that of immaterial spirit, each is evidently composed of
the simple ideas that we have received from sensation or
reflection.
So are all our other ideas of substances, even that
of God himself.


[In section **33** Locke develops that last remark, contending
that we can build up our idea of God as infinitely powerful,
wise, etc. through a general procedure that he illustrates
with an example in section 34.]


**34.** If I find that I know a few things, some or all of them
imperfectly, I can form an idea of knowing twice as many;
which I can double again, ·and so on indefinitely·, just as
I can generate an endless series of numbers by repeated
doubling.
In that way I can enlarge my idea of knowledge by
extending its coverage to all things existing or possible.
And I
can do the same with regard to knowing them more perfectly,
thus forming the idea of infinite or boundless knowledge.
The same may also be done for power. . . .and also for the
duration of existence. . . .
We form the best idea of God that
our minds are capable of, by •taking simple ideas from the
operations of our own minds (through reflection) or from
exterior things (through our senses) and •enlarging them to



the vastness to which infinity can extend them.


**35.** It is infinity—joined to existence, power, knowledge,
etc.—that makes our complex idea of God.
Although in his
own essence (which we don’t know, any more than we know
the real essence of a pebble, or of a fly, or of ourselves) God
may be simple and uncompounded, still our only idea of him
is a complex one whose parts are the ideas of existence,
knowledge, power, happiness, etc.—all this infinite and
eternal. . . .


**36.** Apart from infinity, there is no idea we attribute to God
that isn’t also a part of our complex idea of other Spirits

[here = something like ‘angels’].
We can attribute to Spirits only
ideas that we get from reflection; and we can differentiate
them ·from God on one side, and from us on the other· only
through differences in the extent and degree of knowledge,
power, duration, happiness, etc. that each has.
Here is
another bit of evidence that we are confined to the ideas that
we receive from sensation and reflection: even if we think of
·unembodied· Spirits as ever so much, even _infinitely_, more
advanced than bodies are, we still can’t have any idea of
how they reveal their thoughts one to another.
_We_ have to
use physical signs and particular sounds; they are the best
and quickest we are capable of, which makes them the most
useful we can find.
Of course unembodied Spirits must have
also a more perfect way of communicating their thoughts
than we have; but of such immediate communication we
have no experience in ourselves, and consequently no notion
at all.


**37.** Now we have seen what kind of ideas we have of substances of all kinds, what they consist in, and how we came
by them.
All this, I think, makes three things very evident. **1**
All our ideas of the various sorts of substances are nothing
but collections of simple ideas, together with a supposition


of something to which they belong and in which they exist,
though we have no clear distinct idea at all of this supposed
something. **2** All the simple ideas which—when thus united
in one common substratum—make up our complex ideas of
various sorts of substances are received from sensation or
reflection.
Even •those extremely familiar ideas that apply to
almost everything—·such as the ideas of _time_, _motion_, _body_,
_thought_, _feeling_ ·—have such simple ideas of sensation and
reflection as their only ingredients.
So do •the ideas that
seem furthest from having any connection with us, and that
infinitely surpass anything we can perceive in ourselves by
reflection or discover by sensation in other things.
Even
_those_ ideas must be constructed out of the simple ideas that
we originally received from sensation or reflection.
This is
clearly the case with respect to the complex ideas we have of
angels, and especially our idea of God. **3** Most of the simple
ideas that make up our complex ideas of substances are
really only ·ideas of· powers, however apt we are to think
of them as ·ideas of· positive qualities. [Here again ‘positive’



contrasts with ‘relative’.] For example, most of the ideas that
make our complex idea of gold are yellowness, great weight,
ductility, fusibility and solubility in aqua regia, etc. all united
together in an unknown substratum; and these are all ideas
of gold’s relations to other substances. ·To be heavy is to
have a power to outweigh other things; to be yellow is to
have a power to cause certain visual sensations in human
observers·. [Ductility is the ability to be drawn out into a thin wire,

and fusibility is the ability to melt when hot; neither of which is a relation


to _other_ substances.
Perhaps Locke has a different thought at work here,


not properly expressed: he may be contrasting ‘positive’ qualities not only


with _relative_ qualities but also with _conditional_ ones.
Attributing a power


to something is asserting a conditional about it— _If_ it is heated, it will


melt.
A positive quality such as squareness isn’t like that: the thing just

_is square_, and ‘if’ doesn’t come into it.] These powers depend on the
real and primary qualities of the gold’s internal constitution;
they are what give it its power to operate on other substances
and to be operated on by them; but the powers aren’t really
in the gold considered purely in itself.


# **Chapter xxiv: Collective ideas of substances**



**1.** Besides these complex ideas of various ·kinds of· _single_
substances— _man_, _horse_, _gold_, _violet_, _apple_, etc. the mind
also has complex _collective_ ideas of substances.
Such ideas
are made up of many particular substances considered
together as united into one idea, and which, so joined, are
looked on as one.
For example, the idea of a collection of
men that make an army, though it consists of a great many
distinct substances, is as much _one_ idea as the idea of a



man.
Similarly with the great collective idea of all bodies
whatsoever, signified by the name ‘world’. . . .


[In section **2** Locke contends that power of the mind whereby
it makes collective ideas out of complex ideas of individuals
is the very one by which it makes the latter ideas out of
simple ones.
The crux is this:] It is no harder to conceive
how an army of ten thousand men should make one idea


than to conceive how a man should make one idea. ·Each
involves constructing a complex out of parts that are simple
(or simpler)·.


**3.** Artifacts, or at least the ones that are made up of
distinct substances—·e.g. carriages, houses, clocks·—fall
under collective ideas of the kind I have been discussing.
·Not only do man-made things tend to fall under collective
ideas, but conversely collective ideas are in a special way



man-made·.
All our collective ideas—such as those of army,
constellation, universe—are merely artificial representations
made by the mind.
Such an idea gathers into a single view,
under a single name, things that are very remote from and
independent of one another, so as better to think and talk
about them.
As the meaning of the word ‘universe’ shows,
no things are so remote or unalike that the mind can’t bring
them under a single idea by this technique of composition.


# **Chapter xxv: Relation**



**1.** Besides the ideas, simple and complex, that the mind has
of things considered on their own, it gets other ideas from
comparison between different things. [For Locke, a ‘comparison’


can be any kind of _considering together_ of two things, not necessarily

_likening_ them to one another.] When the understanding thinks
about a thing, it isn’t confined to that precise object: it can
look beyond it, to see how it relates to some other thing.
When the mind sets one thing alongside another (so to
speak) and carries its view from one to the other, this is
what we call _relation_ and _respect_ .
A word is called _relative_ if
applying it to one thing signifies such a respect and leads
the thought from the original subject to something else.
The
things that are thus brought together are said to be _related_ .

[Locke develops all this at some length, contrasting the
non-relational thought that _Caius is white_ with the relational
thoughts that _Caius is a husband_ and that _Caius is whiter_
_than freestone_ .]


[Section **2** points out that many relative terms come in pairs:
‘father’ and ‘son’, ‘bigger’ and ‘smaller’.
Some relative terms
_could_ be paired in this way but happen not to be; Locke gives
the example of ‘concubine’.
He concludes:] All names that
are more than empty sounds must signify some idea that
either •is ·an idea of a quality· in the thing to which the name
is applied, and then it is _positive_ and is looked on as united
to and existing in the thing in question, or •arises from the
respect ·or relation· the mind finds the thing to bear to some
other thing, and then it includes a _relation._


[In section **3** Locke mentions terms that are tacitly relative
though they are sometimes not seen to be so—for example
‘old’, ‘great’, ‘imperfect’, etc.
Section **4** points out that two



people might have very different ideas of _man_ yet exactly
the same idea of _fatherhood_ —different relata, same relation.
Section **5** points out that a relation ceases to hold if one of
the related things ceases to exist.
When his only child dies,
Caius ceases to be a father though he hasn’t altered within
himself.
Also, a thing can be related to many other things,
some of the relations being ‘contrary’ to others: Caius is
older than Titus and younger than Sempronia.]


**6.** Anything that can exist, or be considered as one thing,
is positive ·in contrast to being relative·; and so not only
simple ideas and substances but also modes are positive
beings.
Their parts are very often relative one to another, but
the whole considered together as one thing is a positive or
absolute thing or idea: it produces in us the complex idea
of one thing, and this idea is in our minds as one picture,
under one name, even though it is an aggregate of different
parts.
The parts of ·the idea of· a triangle have relations to
one another, yet the idea of the whole is a positive absolute
idea; ·a thing’s triangularity doesn’t involve how it relates to
anything _else_ ·.
The same may be said of a family, a tune,
etc.
Any relation must be between two things considered as
two things. . . .


**7.** Concerning relation in general, there are four points
to be made.
First, any single •item can be related in an
almost infinite number of ways to other things.
The •item in
question may be

a simple idea
a substance
a mode
a relation


a _name of_ a simple idea or substance or mode or
relation.
·It is a remarkable fact that even •a relation or •a word
can stand in relations to other things, but I shall not
linger on that, and shall instead take the example of the
many in which •a substance can stand to other things·.
Thus, one single man may at once be involved in all these
relations, and many more: father, brother, son, grandfather,
grandson, father-in-law, son-in-law, husband, friend, enemy,
subject, general, judge, patron, client, professor, European,
Englishman, islander, servant, master, possessor, captain,
superior, inferior, bigger, less, older, younger, contemporary,
like, unlike, and so on almost to infinity, he being capable of
as many relations as there can be ways of considering him
together with something else. . . .


**8.** Secondly, although relations aren’t contained in the
real existence of things, but are something extraneous and
added-on, the ideas that relative words stand for are often
clearer and more distinct than of the substances to which
they belong.
The notion we have of _a father_ is a great deal
clearer and more distinct than our idea of _man_ . . . .
That
is because I can often get the notion of a relation from my
knowledge of one action or one simple idea, whereas to know
any substantial being I need an accurate collection of many
ideas. . . .
Thus having the notion that _one laid the egg out_
_of which the other was hatched_ I have a clear idea of _the_
_relation of parent to chick_ between the two cassowaries in St.
James’s Park, although I have only an obscure and imperfect
idea of those birds themselves.


**9.** Thirdly, although ever so many relations hold between one



thing and another, they are all made up of simple ideas of
sensation or reflection—which I think are the whole materials
of all our knowledge.
To establish this I shall show it of •the
most considerable relations that we have any notion of, and
also of •some that seem to be the most remote from sense
or reflection.
The seemingly remote ones will be shown also
to have their ideas from sense or reflection: the notions we
have of those relations are merely certain simple ideas, and
so originally derived from sense or reflection.


**10.** Fourthly, relation is thinking of one thing along with
another, so that any word is relative if it necessarily leads
the mind to any ideas ·of qualities· other than the ones that
are supposed to exist in the thing to which the word is being
applied.
For example, ‘father’, ‘brother’, ‘king’, ‘husband’,
‘blacker’, ‘merrier’, etc. are relative, because each implies
something else separate and exterior to the existence of
the man to whom the word is applied.
By way of contrast,
such terms as ‘black’, ‘merry’, ‘thoughtful’, ‘thirsty’, ‘angry’,
‘extended’ are all absolute [= ‘positive’ = ‘not relative’], because
they don’t signify anything beyond the man to whom they
are applied.


**11.** Having laid down these ·four· premises concerning
relation in general, I shall now proceed to show through
examples how all our ideas of relation, however refined or
remote from sense they seem to be, are made up of nothing
but simple ideas.
I shall begin with the most comprehensive
relation, wherein all things that do or can exist are concerned, namely the relation of _cause and effect_ .
My next
topic is the derivation of this from the two fountains of all
our knowledge, sensation and reflection.


# **Chapter xxvi: Cause and effect, and other relations**



**1.** As we attend to the changes that things constantly
undergo, we can’t help noticing that various qualities and
substances begin to exist, and that they come into existence
through the operations of other things.
From this observation we get our ideas of _cause_ and _effect_ .
We use the general
name ‘cause’ for whatever produces any simple or complex
idea, and ‘effect’ is our name for what is produced.
When
we find that applying a certain degree of heat to a piece of
wax regularly turns it into a fluid, we call the simple idea
of heat the _cause_ of the fluidity, and call fluidity the _effect_
of the heat. . . .
Whatever we consider as conducing to, or
operating to bring into existence, any particular simple idea
or substance or mode that didn’t before exist, we take to be
a _cause_ and we label it accordingly.


**2.** So a cause is what makes some other thing—either simple
idea, substance or mode—come into existence; and an effect
is what is brought into existence by some other thing.
We
have no great difficulty in grouping the various origins of
things into two sorts.
First, when a thing is made of which no part existed
before—e.g. a new particle of matter comes into existence,
having previously had no being.
We call this _creation_ .
Secondly, when a thing is made out of particles all of
which already existed, although the whole thing of which
they are made didn’t previously exist.
Examples would be
a man, an egg, a rose, etc.
When this happens with a
substance that is produced in the ordinary course of nature
by an •internal force that works in •imperceptible ways,
having been triggered by some external agent or cause, we
call it _generation_ .
When the cause is •external to the thing
that comes into existence, and the effect is produced by



separating or joining parts in ways that •we can perceive,
we call it _making_ ; all artificial things are in this category.
When any simple idea [here = ‘quality’] is produced that wasn’t
in that subject before, we call it _alteration_ .
Thus a man
is generated, a picture made, and either of them ·may be·
altered. . . .
Things that are made to exist which weren’t there
before are _effects_, and things that operated to ·produce·
the existence are _causes_ .
In every case the notion of cause
and effect arises out of ideas received through sensation
or reflection; and the cause-effect relation, however widely
applicable it may be, at last terminates in [= ‘comes down to’]
simple ideas.
For all you need to have the idea of cause
and effect is to consider any simple idea or substance as
beginning to exist through the operation of something else;
you don’t have to know _how_ it was done.


[In section **3** Locke remarks that many of our _temporal_
descriptions are really relational, though they don’t appear to
be so on the surface.
For example, when we say ‘Queen Elizabeth reigned for forty-five years’, we are implicitly likening
the length of her reign to the time taken by forty-five annual
revolutions of the sun.
Similarly with all other measures of
time.]


[In section **4** : not only measured time, but also some other
temporal descriptions are covertly relational; for example
‘old’ means one thing applied to a dog and another applied
to a human being, because calling a thing ‘old’ is comparing
its duration with the usual duration of things _of that kind_ .
Where we know nothing of the latter, as with the sun, or a
diamond, ‘young’ and ‘old’ have no application.]


[In section **5** : spatial words such as ‘large’ and ‘small’ are


also covertly relative, in the same way as ‘young’ and old’.
A
large apple is smaller than a small horse.
Statements about
_where_ things are located are openly relational.]


**6.** So likewise ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ are relative, comparing the
subject with some ideas we have at that time of ·something
having· greater or less power.
When we say ‘a weak man’
we mean one who has less strength than men usually
have, or than men of his size usually have. . . .
Similarly,



when we say ‘Creatures are all weak things’ we use ‘weak’
as a relative term, signifying the disproportion in power
between God and his creatures.
An abundance of words
in ordinary speech—perhaps the majority of them—stand
only for relations, though at first sight they seem to have no
such meaning.
For example, in the statement ‘The ship has
necessary stores’, ‘necessary’ and ‘stores’ are both relative
words; one having a relation to accomplishing the intended
voyage, and the other to future use. . . .


# **Chapter xxvii: Identity and diversity**



**1.** Another context in which the mind compares things [=

‘considers things together’] is their _very being_ : when we consider
something as existing at a given time and place and compare
it with itself existing at another time, we are led to form the
ideas of _identity_ and _diversity._ [In this context ‘diversity’ means


‘non-identity’.
To say that _x is diverse from y_ is to say only that _x is not_

_y_ .] When we see a thing—any thing, of whatever sort—to be
in a certain place at a certain time, we are sure that it is
_that very thing_ and not _another thing existing at that time in_
_some other place_, however alike the two may be in all other
respects.
And in this consists _identity_, when the ideas to
which it is attributed don’t vary from what they were at the
moment of their former existence that we are comparing
with the present.
We never find—and can’t even conceive
of—two things of the same kind existing in the same place at
the same time, so we rightly conclude that whatever exists
in a certain place at a certain time excludes all ·others· of
the same kind, and is there itself alone.
So when we ask



whether a thing is ‘the same’ or not, we are always referring
to something that existed at a given time in a given place, a
thing that at that instant was certainly the same as itself and
not the same as anything else.
From this it follows that •one
thing can’t have two beginnings of existence because it is
impossible for one thing to be in different places ·at the same
time·, and •two things can’t have one beginning, because
it is impossible for two things of the same kind to exist in
the same instant at the very same place.
Thus, what had
one beginning is the same thing; and what had a different
beginning in time and place from that is not the same but
diverse.
The difficulties philosophers have had with this
relation ·of identity· have arisen from their not attending
carefully to the precise notions of the things to which it is
attributed.


**2.** We have ideas of only three sorts of substances: _God_,
_finite intelligences_, and _bodies_ . **1** God is without beginning,


eternal, unalterable, and everywhere; and so there can be
no doubt concerning his identity. **2** Each finite spirit had
its determinate time and place of beginning to exist, so its
relation to that time and place will always determine its
identity for as long as it exists. **3** The same holds for every
particle of matter, which continues as the same as long as
no matter is added to or removed from it. . . .
These three
sorts of ‘substances’ (as we call them) don’t exclude _one_
_another_ out of the same place, but we can’t conceive any
of them allowing another _of the same kind_ into its place.
If
that were to happen, the notions and names of identity and
diversity would be useless, and there would be no way of
distinguishing substances or anything else from one another.
For example: if two bodies could be in the same place at
the same time, then those two portions of matter would be
one and the same, whatever their size.
Indeed, _all_ bodies
would be one and the same, because allowing two bodies to
be in one place ·at one time· allows for all bodies to do so.
To
suppose this ·to be possible· is to obliterate the distinction
between identity and diversity, the difference between _one_
and _more_ . . . .
·That all concerned the identity of _substances_ ·.
There
remain _modes_ and _relations_, but because they ultimately
depend on substances [Locke says they are ‘ultimately terminated

in substances’], the identity and diversity of each particular one
of them will be determined in the same way as the identity
of particular substances.
Questions of identity and diversity don’t arise for things
whose existence consists in a sequence ·of events·, such
as the actions of finite beings, e.g. motion and thought.
Because each of these ·events· perishes the moment it begins,
they can’t exist at different times or in different places, as
enduring things can; and therefore no motion or thought
can be the same as any earlier motion or thought.



**3.** There has been much enquiry after the _principle of_
_individuation_ ; but what I have said enables us easily to
discover what that is: it is _existence itself,_ which ties a being
of a given sort to a particular time and place that can’t be
shared by any other being of the same kind.
This seems
easier to conceive in _simple_ substances or modes, but if
we are careful we can just as easily apply it to _compound_
ones.
Consider an atom, i.e. a continued body under one
unchanging surface, existing at a particular time and place:
it is evident that at that instant it is the same as itself.
For being at that instant what it is and nothing else, it is
the same and so must continue as long as its existence is
continued; for so long it will be the same and no other. [That

sentence is Locke’s.] Similarly, if two or more atoms are joined
together into a single mass, every one of those atoms will be
the same by the foregoing rule.
And while they exist united
together, the mass whose parts they are must be the same
mass, or the same body, however much the parts have been
re-arranged.
But if one atom is removed from the mass, or
one new one added, it is no longer the same mass, or the
same body.
The identity of living creatures depends not on
a mass of the same particles but on something else.
For in
them the variation of large amounts of matter doesn’t alter
the identity.
An oak growing from a sapling to a great tree,
and then lopped, is still the same oak; and a colt grown up
to be a horse, sometimes fat, sometimes lean, is the same
horse throughout all this.
In neither case is there the same
mass of matter, though there truly is the same oak, or horse.
That is because in these two cases, a mass of matter and a
living body, identity isn’t applied to the same thing.


**4.** How, then, does an oak differ from a mass of matter?
The answer seems to me to be this: the _mass_ is merely the
cohesion of particles of matter anyhow united, whereas the


_oak_ is such a disposition of particles as constitutes the parts
of an oak, and an organization of those parts that enables
the whole to receive and distribute nourishment so as to
continue and form the wood, bark, and leaves, etc. of an
oak, in which consists the vegetable life.
Thus, something is
_one plant_ if it has an organization of parts in one cohering
body partaking of one common life, and it continues to be _the_
_same plant_ as long as it partakes of the same life, even if that
life is passed along to new particles of matter vitally united to
the living plant, in a similar continued organization suitable
for that sort of plants.
This organization is at any one instant
in some one _collection of matter_, which distinguishes it from
all others at that instant; and what has the identity that
makes the same _plant_ is


that _individual life_, existing constantly from that moment forwards and backwards, in the same continuity
of imperceptibly succeeding parts united to the living
body of the plant.

It also makes all the parts of it be parts of the same plant, for
as long as they exist united in that continued organization
that is fit to convey that common life to all the parts so
united.


**5.** The identity of lower animals is sufficiently like that for
anyone to be able to see, from what I have said, what makes
one animal and continues it the same.
It can be illustrated
by something similar, namely the identity of machines.
_What_
_is a watch?_ Clearly it is nothing but a construction of parts
organized to a certain end—an end that it can attain when
sufficient force is applied to it.
If we suppose this machine to
be one continued body whose parts were repaired, added to,
or subtracted from, by a constant addition or separation of
imperceptible parts, with one common life, it would be very
much like the body of an animal; with the difference that



in an animal the fitness of the organization and the motion
wherein life consists begin together, because the motion
comes from within; but in a machine the force can be seen
to come from outside, and is often lacking even when the
machine is in order and well fitted to receive it—·for example,
when a clock isn’t wound up·.


**6.** This also shows what the identity of the _same man_ consists in, namely: a participation in the same continued life by
constantly fleeting particles of matter that are successively
vitally united to the same organized body.
If you place the
identity of man in anything but this, you’ll find it hard to
make an embryo and an adult the same man, or a well
man and a madman the same man. ·Your only chance of
doing this is by tying ‘same man’ to ‘same soul’, but by that
standard you will· make it possible for Seth, Ismael, Socrates,
Pilate, St.
Augustine, and Cesare Borgia to be the same man.
If identity of soul alone makes the same man, and nothing
in the nature of matter rules out an individual spirit’s being
united to different bodies, it will be possible that those men
with their different characters and living at widely different
times, may have been the same man!
That strange way of
using the word ‘man’ is what one is led to by giving it a
meaning from which body and shape are excluded. . . .


**7.** So unity of substance does not constitute all sorts of
identity.
To conceive and judge correctly about identity, we
must consider what idea the word it is applied to stands for:
it is one thing to be the same _substance_, another the same
_man_, and a third the same _person_, if ‘person’, ‘man’, and
‘substance’ are names for three different ideas; for such as is
the idea belonging to that name, such must be the identity.
If this had been more carefully attended to, it might have
prevented a great deal of that confusion that often occurs
regarding identity, and especially personal identity, to which


I now turn ·after one more section on ‘same man’·.


**8.** An animal is a living organized body; and consequently
the same animal, as I have said, is the same continued
life communicated to different particles of matter, as they
are successively united to that organized living body.
And
whatever other definitions are propounded, there should be
no doubt that the word ‘man’ as we use it stands for the idea
of an animal of a certain form. ·The time-hallowed definition
of ‘man’ as ‘rational animal’ is wrong·.
If we should see
•a creature of our own shape and ·physical· constitution,
though it had no more reason all its life than a cat or a
parrot, we would still call him a man; and anyone who heard
•a cat or a parrot talk, reason, and philosophize would still
think it to be a cat or a parrot and would describe it as such.
One of these two is •a dull, irrational man, the other •a very
intelligent rational parrot. [Locke then quotes a tediously
long traveller’s tale about encountering a rational parrot.
His point is that someone who believes this account will go
thinking of this rational animal as a parrot, not as a man.]


**9.** With ‘same man’ in hand, let us turn to ‘same person’.
To find what _personal_ identity consists in, we must consider
what ‘person’ stands for.
I think it is _a thinking intelligent be-_
_ing, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as_
_itself, the same thinking thing at different times and places_ .
What enables it to think of itself is its _consciousness_, which
is inseparable from thinking and (it seems to me) essential to
it.
It is impossible for anyone to perceive, without perceiving
that he perceives.
When we see, hear, smell, taste, feel,
meditate, or will anything, we know that we do so.
It is
always like that with our present sensations and perceptions.
And it is through this that everyone is to himself that which
he calls ‘self’, not raising the question of whether the same
self is continued in the same substance.
Consciousness



always accompanies thinking, and makes everyone to be
what he calls ‘self’ and thereby distinguishes himself from
all other thinking things; in this alone consists personal
identity, i.e. the sameness of a rational being; and as far as
this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past
action or thought, so far reaches the identity of that person;
it is the same self now that it was then; and this present self
that now reflects on it is the one by which that action was
performed.


**10.** Given that it is the same _person_, is it the same identical
_substance_ ?
Most people would think that it _is_ the same
substance if these perceptions with their consciousness
always remained present in the mind, making the same
thinking thing always consciously present and (most people
would think) evidently the same to itself.
What seems to
make the difficulty—·that is, to make it at least questionable
whether the same person must be the same substance·—is
the following fact. •Consciousness is often interrupted by
forgetfulness, and at no moment of our lives do we have
the whole sequence of all our past actions before our eyes
in one view; even the best memories lose the sight of one
part while they are viewing another.
Furthermore, •for the
greatest part of our lives we don’t reflect on our past selves
at all, because we are intent on our present thoughts or (in
sound sleep) have no thoughts at all, or at least none with
the consciousness that characterizes our waking thoughts.
In all these cases our consciousness is interrupted, and we
lose the sight of our past selves, and so doubts are raised
as to whether or not we are the same thinking thing, i.e. the
same substance.

That may be a reasonable question, but it has nothing
to do with personal identity.
For the latter, the question is
about what makes the same _person_, and not whether the


same identical _substance_ always thinks in the same person.
Different substances might all partake in a single consciousness and thereby be united into one person, just as different
bodies can enter into the same life and thereby be united
into one animal, whose identity is preserved throughout that
change of substances by the unity of the single continued
life.
What makes a man be himself _to himself_ is sameness
of consciousness, so personal identity depends entirely on
that—whether the consciousness is tied to one substance
throughout or rather is continued in a series of different
substances.
For as far as any thinking being can repeat the
idea of any past action with the same consciousness that he
had of it at first, and with the same consciousness he has
of his present actions, so far is he the same personal self.
For it is by the consciousness he has of his present thoughts
and actions that he is _self to himself_ now, and so will be the
same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to
actions past or to come.
Distance of time doesn’t make him
two or more persons, and nor does change of substance; any
more than a man is made to be two men by having a long or
short sleep or by changing his clothes.


**11.** Our own bodies give us some kind of evidence for this.
All the particles of your body, while they are vitally united
to a single thinking conscious self—so that you feel when
they are touched, and are affected by and conscious of good
or harm that happens to them—are a part of yourself, i.e.
of your thinking conscious self.
Thus the limbs of his body
are to everyone a part of himself; he feels for them and is
concerned for them.
Cut off a hand and thereby separate
it from that consciousness the person had of its heat, cold,
and other states, and it is then no longer a part of himself,
any more than is the remotest material thing.
Thus we see
the substance of which the personal self consisted at one



time may be varied at another without change of personal
identity; for there is no doubt that it is the same person,
even though one of its limbs has been cut off.


**12.** But it is asked: _Can it be the same person if the_
_substance changes?_ and _Can it be different persons if the_
_same substance does the thinking throughout?_
·Before I address these questions in sections 13 and 14,
there’s a preliminary point I want to make.
It is that· neither
question is alive for those who hold that thought is a property
of a purely material animal constitution, with no immaterial
substance being involved.
Whether or not they are right
about that, they obviously conceive personal identity as being
preserved in something other than identity of substance;
just as animal identity is preserved in identity of life, not of
substance. ·This pair of questions does present a challenge
to· •those who hold that only immaterial substances can
think, ·and that sameness of person requires sameness
of immaterial substance.
Before •they can confront their
materialist opponents, they· have to show why personal
identity can’t be preserved through a change of immaterial
substances, just as animal identity is preserved through a
change of material substances.
Unless they say that what
makes the same life ·and thus the animal identity· in lower
animals is one immaterial spirit, just as (according to them)
one immaterial spirit makes the same person in men—and
Cartesians at least won’t take that way out, for fear of making
the lower animals thinking things too.


**13.** As to the first question, _If the thinking substance is_
_changed, can it be the same person?_, I answer that this can
be settled only by those who know •what kind of substances
they are that think, and •whether the consciousness of past
actions can be transferred from one such substance to another.
Admittedly, if the same consciousness were •the same


individual action, it couldn’t be transferred ·because in that
case bringing a past headache (say) into one’s consciousness
would be bringing back _that very headache_, and _that_ is
tied to the substance to which it occurred.
But a present
consciousness of a past event isn’t like that.
Rather·, it is •a
present _representation of_ a past action, and we have still to
be shown why something can’t be represented to the mind
as having happened though really it did not.
How far the
consciousness of past actions is tied to one individual agent,
so that another can’t possibly have it, will be hard for us to
determine until we know

•what kind of action it is that can’t be done without a
reflex act of perception accompanying it, and
•how such an action is done by thinking substances
who can’t think without being conscious of it.
In our present state of knowledge it is hard to see how it
can be impossible, in the nature of things, for an intellectual substance to have represented to it as done by itself
something that it never did, and was perhaps done by some
other agent. . . .
Until we have a clearer view of the nature
of thinking substances, we had better assume that such
changes of substance within a single person never do _in_
_fact_ happen, basing this on the goodness of God.
Having a
concern for the happiness or misery of his creatures, he won’t
transfer from one ·substance· to another the consciousness
that draws reward or punishment with it. . . .


**14.** The second question, _Can it be different persons if_
_the same substance does the thinking throughout?_, seems
to me to arise out of the question of whether the following is
possible:

An immaterial being that has been conscious of
the events in its past is wholly stripped of all that
consciousness, losing it beyond the power of ever



retrieving it again; so that now it (as it were) opens
a new account, with a new starting date, having a
consciousness that can’t reach ·back· beyond this
new state.
·Really, the question is whether if this happened it could be
the same _person_ who had first one consciousness and then
another, with no possibility of communication between them·.

[Locke says that this must be regarded as possible by ‘those
who hold pre-existence’, that is, who believe in reincarnation.
He attacks them, thereby attacking the separation of ‘same
person’ from ‘same consciousness’, and proposes a thoughtexperiment:] Reflect on yourself, and conclude that you have
in yourself an immaterial spirit that is what thinks in you,
keeps you the same throughout the constant change of your
body, and is what you call ‘myself’.
Now try to suppose also
that it is the same soul that was in Nestor or Thersites at the
siege of Troy.
This isn’t obviously absurd; for souls, as far as
we know anything of their nature, can go with any portion of
matter as well as with any other; so the •soul ·or thinking
substance· that is now _yourself_ may once really have been
the •soul of someone else, such as Thersites or Nestor.
But
you don’t now have any consciousness of any of the actions
either of those two; so can you conceive yourself as being the
same • _person_ with either of them?
Can their actions have
anything to do with you?
Can you attribute those actions to
yourself, or think of them as yours more than the actions of
any other men that ever existed? ·Of course you can’t·. . . .


**15.** So we can easily conceive of being the same person
at the resurrection, though in a body with partly different
parts or structure from what one has now, as long as the
same consciousness stays with the soul that inhabits the
body.
But the soul alone, in the change of bodies, would
not be accounted enough to make the same man—except by


someone who identifies the soul with the man.
If the soul of
a prince, carrying with it the consciousness of the prince’s
past life, were to enter and inform the body of a cobbler who
has been deserted by his own soul, everyone sees that he
would be the same person as the prince, accountable only
for the prince’s actions; but who would say it was the same
man?
The body contributes to making the man, and in this
case I should think everyone would let the body settle the
‘same man’ question, not dissuaded from this by the soul,
with all its princely thoughts.
To everyone but himself he
would be the same cobbler, the same man.
I know that in
common parlance ‘same person’ and ‘same man’ stand for
the same thing; and of course everyone will always be free to
speak as he pleases, giving words what meanings he thinks
fit, and changing them as often as he likes.
Still, when we
want to explore what makes the same spirit, man, or person,
we must fix the ideas of spirit, man, or person in our minds;
and when we have become clear about what we mean by
them, we shan’t find it hard to settle, for each of them, when
it is ‘the same’ and when not.


**16.** But although the same •immaterial substance or soul
does not by itself, in all circumstances, make the same man,
it is clear that •consciousness unites actions—whether from
long ago or from the immediately preceding moment—into
the same person.
Whatever has the consciousness of present
and past actions is the same person to whom they both
belong.
If my present consciousness that I am now writing
were also a consciousness that •I saw an overflowing of
the Thames last winter and that •I saw Noah’s ark and the
flood, I couldn’t doubt that I who write this now am the
same self that saw the Thames overflowed last winter and
viewed the flood at the general deluge—place that self in
what substance you please.
I could no more doubt this than



I can doubt that I who write this am the same _myself_ now
while I write as I was yesterday, whether or not I consist of all
the same substance, material or immaterial.
For sameness
of substance is irrelevant to sameness of self: I am as much
involved in—and as justly accountable for—•an action that
was done a thousand years ago and is appropriated to me
now by this self-consciousness as I am for •what I did a
moment ago.


**17.** _Self_ is that conscious thinking thing that feels or is
conscious of pleasure and pain and capable of happiness
or misery, and so is concerned for itself as far as that
consciousness extends. (This holds true whatever substance
the thinking thing is made up of; it doesn’t matter whether
it is spiritual or material, simple or compounded.) You
must find that while your little finger is brought under your
consciousness it is as much a part of yourself as is your
head or your heart.
If the finger were amputated and this
consciousness went along with it, deserting the rest of the
body, it is evident that the little finger would then be the
person, the same person; and ·this· self would then would
have nothing to do with the rest of the body.
As with spatial
separation so also with temporal: something with which the
consciousness of this present thinking thing can join itself
makes the same person, and is one self with it, as everyone
who reflects will perceive.


**18.** Personal identity is the basis for all the right and justice
of reward and punishment.
What everyone is concerned for,
for himself, is happiness and misery—with no concern for
what becomes of any substance that isn’t connected with
that consciousness. [Locke goes on to apply that to his
‘finger’ example, supposing that the finger takes the original
consciousness with it, and that the rest of the body acquires
a new consciousness.]


**19.** This illustrates my thesis that personal identity consists not in the identity of substance but in the identity
of consciousness.
If Socrates and the present mayor of
Queenborough agree in _that_, they are the same person; if
Socrates awake doesn’t partake of the same consciousness
as Socrates sleeping, they aren’t the same person.
And
to punish Socrates awake for something done by sleeping
Socrates without Socrates awake ever being conscious of it
would be as unjust as to punish someone for an action of his
twin brother’s merely because their outsides were so alike
that they couldn’t be distinguished.


**20.** It may be objected: ‘Suppose I wholly lose the memory
of some parts of my life beyond any possibility of retrieving
them, so that I shall never be conscious of them again; aren’t
I still the same person who did those actions, had those
thoughts that I once was conscious of, even though I have
now forgotten them?’ To this I answer that we must be
careful about what the word ‘I’ is applied to.
This objector
is thinking of sameness of the _man_, and calls it ‘I’ because
he assumes that the same man is the same _person_ .
But ·the
assumption isn’t necessarily correct·.
If one man could have
distinct disconnected consciousnesses at different times,
that _same man_ would certainly make different _persons_ at
different times.
That this is what people in general think
can be seen in the most solemn declaration of their opinions:
human laws don’t punish the madman for the sane man’s
actions, or the sane man for what the madman did, because
they treat them as two persons.
This is reflected in common
speech when we say that someone is ‘not himself’ or is ‘beside
himself’.Those phrases insinuate that the speaker thinks—or
that those who coined the phrases thought—that the self
was changed, the self-same person was no longer in that
man.



**21.** ‘It is still hard to conceive that Socrates, the same
individual man, might be two persons.’ To help us with this
we must consider what is meant by ‘Socrates’, or ‘the same
individual man’. ·There are three options·.
The same man
might be any of these:

**1** the same individual, immaterial, thinking substance;
in short, the numerically-same soul and nothing else,
**2** the same animal, without any regard to an immaterial soul,
**3** the same immaterial spirit united to the same animal.
Help yourself!
On any of these accounts of ‘same man’, it is
impossible for personal identity to consist in anything but
consciousness, or reach any further than that does.
According to **1**, a man born of different women, and in
distant times, might still be the same man.
Anyone who
allows _this_ must also allow that the same man could be two
distinct persons. . . .
According to **2** and **3**, •Socrates in this life cannot be the
same man as •anyone in the after-life.
The only way to do
this—·allowing for the possibility that •Socrates in Athens
and •Socrates in Limbo are the same man·—is through an
appeal to sameness of consciousness; and that amounts to
equating human identity—·‘same man’·—with personal identity.
But ·that equation is problematic, because· it makes
it hard to see how the •infant Socrates can be the same
man as •Socrates after the resurrection.
There seems to be
little agreement about what makes a man, and thus about
what makes the same individual man; but whatever we think
about that, if we are not to fall into great absurdities we must
agree that sameness of person resides in consciousness.


**22.** You may want to object: ‘But isn’t a man drunk and
sober the same person?
Why else is he punished for what he
does when drunk, even if he is never afterwards conscious of


it?
He is just as much a single person as a man who walks
in his sleep and is answerable, while awake, for any harm
he did in his sleep.’ ·Here is my reply to that·.
Human laws
punish both, with a justice suitable to the state of knowledge
of those who administer the law: in these cases they can’t
distinguish for sure what is real from what is counterfeit;
and so they don’t allow the ignorance in drunkenness or
sleep as a plea.
Granted: punishment is tied to personhood,
which is tied to consciousness, and the drunkard may not be
conscious of what he did; but the courts justly punish him,
because •his bad actions are proved _against_ him, and •his
lack of consciousness of them can’t be proved _for_ him.
It may
be reasonable to think that on the great day when the secrets
of all hearts are laid open, nobody will be held accountable for
actions of which he knows nothing; everybody will receive his
sentence with his conscience ·agreeing with God’s judgment
by· accusing or excusing him.


**23.** Nothing but consciousness can unite remote existences
into the same person.
The identity of substance won’t do
it.
For whatever substance there is, and whatever it is like,
without consciousness there is no person.
A substance
without consciousness can no more be a person that a
carcass can. [In the remainder of this section, and in section
**24**, Locke discusses possible cases: two persons who take
turns in animating one animal body (‘the night man and the
day man’); and one person who alternately animates two
different animal bodies.
The central emphasis throughout is
on the uselessness in these questions of the concept of the
same immaterial substance.]


**25.** I agree ·that on the question of contingent fact· the
more probable opinion is that this consciousness is tied to,
and is a state of, a single immaterial substance.
Please
yourself about that.
However, every thinking being that can



experience happiness or misery must grant that


there is something, _himself_, that he is concerned for
and wants to be happy; and that this self has existed
continuously for a period of time and therefore may
exist for months and years to come, with no set limit
to its duration, and thus may be the same self carried
by consciousness into the future.

It is through this consciousness that he finds himself to
be the same self that acted thus and so some years ago
and through which he is happy or miserable now.
In all
these thoughts we place sameness of _self_ in sameness not
of _substance_ but of _consciousness_ .
Substances might come
and go through the duration of such a consciousness; and
_for as long as a substance is in a vital union with the thing_
_containing this consciousness_ it is a part of that same self.
Thus, any part of my body, while vitally united to that which
is conscious in me, is a part of myself (·for example my
little finger, while it relates to me in such a way that if it is
damaged I feel pain·); but when the vital union is broken,
what was a part of myself a moment ago is now not so,
any more than a part of another man’s self is a part of me.

[The rest of the section illustrates and repeats this line of
thought.]


**26.** ‘Person’, I take it, is the name for this _self_ .
Wherever
you find what you call ‘myself’, anyone else may say there
is ‘the same person’. ‘Person’ is a forensic term [= ‘a term

designed for use in legal proceedings’], having to do with actions
and their merit; and so it applies only to active thinking
beings that are capable of a law, and of happiness and misery.
It is only through consciousness that this personality [Locke’s

word] extends itself beyond present existence to what is past,
becoming concerned and accountable; the person owns and
attributes _past_ actions to itself for the same reason that


it does the _present_ .
All this is founded in a concern for
happiness, which unavoidably accompanies consciousness—
something that is conscious of pleasure and pain desires
that the self that is conscious should be happy.
As for past
actions that the self cannot through consciousness square
with or join to the present self—it can no more be concerned
with them than if they had never been done.
To •receive
pleasure or pain, i.e. reward or punishment, on account of
any such action is all of a piece with •being born happy or
miserable, without any ·merit or· demerit at all.
Suppose a
man were punished now for what he had done in another
life of which he cannot have any consciousness, how does
that ·so-called· punishment differ from simply being created
miserable?. . . .


**27.** In treating this subject I have considered as perhapspossible some states of affairs—·e.g. the one about the prince
and the cobbler·—that will look strange to some readers, and
perhaps _are_ strange.
But I think they are permissible, given
our ignorance about the nature of the thinking thing in us
which we look on as our _selves_ .
If we knew with regard to
this thinking thing

•what it is, or
•how it is tied to a certain system of fleeting animal
spirits [see note in viii.12], or
•whether or not it can perform its operations of thinking and memory outside of a body organized as ours
is, and
•whether God has decided that every such spirit ·or
thinking thing· shall be united to only one such body,
with its memory depending on the health of that body’s
organs,
we might see the absurdity of some of the cases I considered.
But as we are in the dark about these matters, we ordinarily



think of the ·thinking thing or· soul of a man as an immaterial substance, owing nothing to matter and compatible with
any kind of matter; and on that basis there cannot from the
nature of things be any absurdity in supposing that the same
soul might at different times be united to different bodies,
making _one man_ with each of them for as long as they were
united. . . .


**28.** To conclude: •any substance that begins to exist must
during its existence necessarily be the same; •any complex of
substances that begins to exist must during the existence of
its component parts be the same; •any mode that begins to
exist is throughout its existence the same. . . .
It appears from
this that the difficulty or obscurity that people have found
in this matter has arisen from the poor use of words rather
than from any obscurity in things themselves.
For whatever
makes the specific idea to which the name is applied, if we
steadily keep to that idea it will be easy for us to distinguish
same and different, with no doubts arising. ·I defend this in
the next, final section·.


**29.** •Suppose we take a man to be _a rational spirit_, then it
is easy to know what is the same man, namely the same
spirit—whether or not it is embodied. •Suppose our idea
of a man is _a rational spirit vitally united to a body with a_
_certain structure_ ; then such a rational spirit will be the same
man as long as it is united to such a body, though it needn’t
be the same body throughout. •If anyone’s idea of a man
is that of the vital union of parts in a certain shape [here =

‘structure’], as long as that vital union and shape remain in a
compound body, remaining the same except for a turnover
in its constituent particles, it will be the same man.
For the
complex idea we use when classifying a thing as being of a
certain kind also determines what it is for a thing of that
kind to continue in existence.


# **Chapter xxviii: Other relations**



**1.** We can compare [= ‘relate’] or refer things one to another
in respect of time, place, and causality, all of which I have
discussed.
We can also do so in countless other respects,
of which I shall mention some.
First, a simple idea [here

= ‘quality’] that is capable of _parts_ or _degrees_ enables us to
compare the things that have it to one another in respect of
that simple idea—for example whiter, sweeter, equal·ly white·,
more ·sweet·, etc.
These relations depend on the equality
and excess of the same simple idea in several subjects, and
may be called _proportional_ . . . .


**2.** Secondly, we can also relate things, or think of one thing
in a way that brings in the thought of another, in respect
of the circumstances of their origin or beginning.
Such
relations can’t change through time, so they are as lasting
as are the things related.
Examples include father and son,
brothers, first cousins, etc.—all the blood relationships, close
and distant; and countrymen, i.e. those who were born in
the same country, or region.
I call these _natural relations_ .
We can see here how mankind have fitted their notions and
words to daily needs and not to the truth and extent of things.
For the relation of begetter to begotten is exactly the same
in other species as in men; yet we don’t ordinarily say ‘This
bull is the grandfather of that calf’ or ‘Those two pigeons
are first cousins’. [Locke develops this point, remarking that
some of our human-relational terms are needed in the law,
and notes that cultures differ in this respect.
He concludes:]
This makes it easy to guess why in some countries they
don’t even have a word meaning what ‘horse’ does for us,
while in others, where they care more about the pedigrees
of their horses than about their own, they have not only
names for particular horses but also words for their various



blood-relationships to one another.


**3.** Thirdly, sometimes things are brought together in a single
thought on the basis of moral rights, powers, or obligations.
Thus a _general_ is one who has power to command an army;
and an _army_ under a general is a collection of armed men
obliged to obey one man.
A _citizen_ is one who has a right
to certain privileges in a given place.
Such relations depend
on men’s wills, or on agreement in society, so I call them
‘instituted’ or ‘voluntary’.
Unlike the natural relations, most
(if not all) of these are in some way alterable; two people
related in such a way may cease to be so, while they both
continue in existence.
These relations, like all the others,
involve relating two things to one another; but in many cases
the relative nature of the term is overlooked because we
have no standard relative name for one of the two subjects
of the relation.
For example, ‘patron’ and ‘client’ are easily
recognized as relational ·because they come as a pair—if x is
y’s patron then y is x’s client·—but ‘constable’ and ‘dictator’
are not, because there is no special name for those who are
under the command of a dictator or of a constable. . . .


**4.** Fourthly, another sort of relation has to do with whether
or not men’s voluntary actions conform to some rule in
terms of which they are judged.
I think this may be called
_moral_ relation, because it concerns our moral·ly significant·
actions.
It deserves to be examined thoroughly, for there is
no part of knowledge where we should be more careful to
get fixed ideas and to do what we can to avoid obscurity and
confusion. ·It will be my topic throughout the rest of this
chapter·.


When human actions—with their various ends, objects,
manners, and circumstances—are brought under distinct
complex ideas, these are mixed modes, many of them with
associated names.
Taking _gratitude_ to be a readiness to
acknowledge and return kindness received, and _polygamy_ to
be the having of more than one wife at a time, when we form
these notions in our minds we have there a couple of settled
ideas of mixed modes.
But our concern with our actions isn’t
merely to know what complex ideas apply to them ·and thus
how they should be classified·.
We have another, greater,
concern which is to know whether the actions thus classified
are morally good or bad.


**5.** Good and evil, as I showed in xx.2 and xxi.42, are nothing
but pleasure or pain, or what procures pleasure or pain
for us.
So _moral_ good and evil is only the conformity or
disagreement of our voluntary actions to some law, through
which good or evil is drawn on us by the will and power of the
law-maker.
Such •good or evil, •pleasure or pain, that the
law-maker decrees to follow from our observance or breach
of the law is what we call •reward or punishment.


**6.** Of these moral rules or laws on the basis of which men
generally judge the moral status of their actions, there seem
to me to be three sorts, with three different enforcements, or
rewards and punishments. ·Before listing them in section
7 and discussing them in 8–10, I defend my assumption
that any kind of law _does_ have a system of punishment
and reward associated with it·.
It would be utterly pointless
for one thinking being to lay down a rule to govern the
actions of another unless he had it in his power to reward
compliance and punish deviation from his rule by some good
or evil that isn’t the natural consequence of the action itself.
A _natural_ convenience or inconvenience would operate by
itself, without help from a law.
This ·association with reward



and punishment· is, if I am not mistaken, the true nature of
all law, properly so called.


**7.** The laws that men generally relate their actions to, in
judging whether they are right or wrong, seem to me to be
these three. 1.
The divine law. 2.
The civil law. 3.
The law of
opinion or reputation, if I may so call it.
By their relation to
the first of these, men judge whether their actions are _sins_
or _duties_ ; by the second, whether _criminal_ or _innocent_ ; and
by the third, whether _virtues_ or _vices_ .


**8.** First, there is the divine law, by which I mean the law
that God has set for the actions of men, whether announced
to them by the light of nature or by the voice of revelation.
Nobody is so cloddish as to deny that God has given men a
rule by which to govern themselves.
He has •a right to do it,
because we are his creatures; he has •goodness and wisdom
to direct our actions to what is best; and he has •power to
enforce it by infinitely weighty rewards and punishments
in the after-life.
For nobody can take us out of his hands.
This is the only true touchstone of moral rectitude; and it is
by comparing their actions to this law that men judge the
most considerable moral good or evil in their actions—that
is, judge whether as duties or sins they are likely to procure
them happiness or misery from the hands of God.


**9.** Secondly, there is the civil law, the rule set by a nation
to ·govern· the actions of those who belong to it.
Men relate
their actions to this also, in judging whether or not they
are criminal.
Nobody ignores civil law, because the rewards
and punishments that enforce it are ready at hand and are
suitable to the power that makes this law, That is the force
of the commonwealth, which is obliged to protect the lives,
liberties, and possessions of those who live according to its
law, and has the power to take away life, liberty, or goods
from anyone who disobeys, that being the punishment of


offences against this law.


**10.** Thirdly, there is the law of opinion or reputation. ‘Virtue’
and ‘vice’ are names that are everywhere said and thought to
apply to actions on the basis of their being inherently right or
wrong; and as far as they really _are_ applied in that way they
to that extent coincide with the divine law above-mentioned.
But whatever people say, we can see that the names ‘virtue’
and ‘vice’, in particular instances of their use throughout the
various nations and societies in the world, are constantly
attributed only to such actions as are in _approved of_ or
_disapproved of_ in the country or society concerned.
It isn’t
surprising that men everywhere should call ‘virtuous’ the
actions that they judge to be praiseworthy, and call ‘vicious’
the ones they regard as blameable; for otherwise they would
condemn themselves by thinking something right without
commending it, or wrong without blaming it.
Thus what
people say and think about virtue and vice is measured by
the approval or dislike, praise or blame, which is silently
agreed on in a society or tribe or club.
When men unite into
political societies they hand over to the public the decisions
about how •their force is to be used, so that they can’t employ
it against any fellow-citizens further than the law of the
country directs; but they hang onto •the power of approving
or disapproving of the actions of members of their society;
and by this approval and dislike they establish amongst
themselves what they call virtue and vice.


**11.** You will agree that this is the common measure of
virtue and vice if you consider the fact that although what
passes for vice in one country may be counted a virtue,
or at least not a vice, in another; yet everywhere virtue
and praise go together, as do vice and blame.
Virtue is
everywhere what is thought praiseworthy, and nothing _but_
what is publicly esteemed is called virtue. . . .
Differences



in personal character, education, fashion, interests and so
on can bring it about that what is thought praiseworthy
in one place is censured in another; and so in different
societies virtues and vices may sometimes have exchanged
places; but in the main they have kept the same everywhere.
·What has kept standards of virtue and vice pretty much
•the same as one another is what has kept them all pretty
much •the same as the standards of right and wrong laid
down by God.
Here is why·. •Nothing can be more natural
than to encourage with esteem and reputation what everyone
finds to his advantage, and to blame and discountenance
the contrary; and •nothing so directly and visibly advances
the general good of mankind in this world as obedience to
the laws that God has set for them, and nothing breeds such
mischief and confusion as the neglect of those laws; and so
•it is no wonder that esteem and discredit, virtue and vice,
should to a large extent coincide with the unchangeable rule
of right and wrong that the law of God has established.
If
people generally went wrong by placing their commendation
or blame on the side that didn’t really deserve it, they would
be renouncing all sense and reason, and also renouncing
their own interests, to which they are in fact constantly true.
Even men who _behave_ badly bestow their _approval_ in the
right places; few of them are so depraved that they don’t
condemn, at least in others, the faults they themselves are
guilty of. . . .


**12.** You might want to object:


When you say that the law by which men judge of
virtue and vice is nothing but the consent of private
men who haven’t enough authority to make a law,
you are forgetting your own notion of a law, omitting
something that ·according to you· is necessary and
essential to a law, namely a power to enforce it.


I reply that if you imagine that commendation and disgrace don’t strongly motivate men to accommodate themselves to the opinions and rules of those with whom they have
dealings, you can’t know much about the nature or history
of mankind!
Most people _do_ govern themselves chiefly, if not
solely, by this _law of fashion_ ; so they do what keeps them in
reputation with their peers, having little regard for the laws of
God or the law of the land.
Some men—perhaps indeed _most_
men—seldom reflect seriously on the penalties for breaking
God’s laws; and amongst those that do, many go ahead
and break the law anyway, entertaining thoughts of future
reconciliation ·with God·, and making their peace ·with him·
for such breaches.
As for the punishments due from the laws
of the commonwealth, men frequently comfort themselves
with hopes of impunity.
But no man who offends against
the fashion and opinion of the society he belongs to and
wants to be accepted by can escape the punishment of their
censure and dislike.
Not one man in ten thousand is stiff and
thick-skinned enough to bear up under the constant dislike
and condemnation of his own social circle.
Someone who can
content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute
with his own particular society must have a strange and
unusual constitution!
Many men have sought solitude and
been reconciled to it; but nobody who thinks at all—nobody
with the least sense of _a man_ about him—can live in society
under the constant dislike and poor opinion of his associates.
That is too heavy a burden for humans to bear. . . .


[Section **13** briefly sums up the three laws.]


**14.** We test the goodness of an action by relating it to •a
rule (like testing the quality of gold by rubbing it against a
touchstone); the outcome of that test determines how we
name the action, and that name is the sign of what value we
attribute to it.
Whether we take •the rule from the fashion of



the country or from the will of a ·human or divine· law-maker,
the mind can easily see how a given action relates to it, and
so it has a notion of moral good/evil, which is an action’s
conformity/nonconformity to that rule, and therefore is often
called moral rectitude.
This rule is merely a collection of
several simple ideas, so that to judge whether an action
conforms to it one has only to organize ·one’s thought of· it so
as to see whether the simple ideas belonging to _it_ correspond
to the ones that the law requires.
And so we see how moral
notions are founded on, and come down to, the simple ideas
we have received from sensation or reflection.
For example,
consider the complex idea we signify by the word ‘murder’:
when we have dismantled it and examined all its parts we
shall find them to be a collection of simple ideas derived from
reflection or sensation. •From reflection: the ideas of willing,
considering, intending in advance, malice; and also of life,
perception, and self-motion. •From sensation: the collection
of those simple sensible ideas that are ·of qualities· to be
found in _a man,_ and of _an action_ through which a man no
longer has perception or motion—·i.e. through which a man
becomes dead·.
All these simple ideas are brought together
in ·the meaning of· the word ‘murder’.
When I find that
this collection of simple ideas agrees or disagrees with the
esteem of the country I have grown up in, and is regarded
by most men there as worthy praise or blame, I call the
action •virtuous or vicious accordingly.
If I have the will of a
supreme invisible law-giver for my rule, then I call the action
•good or bad, sin or duty, according to whether I think it has
been commanded or forbidden by God.
And if I compare the
action to the civil law, the rule made by the legislative power
of the country, I call it •lawful or unlawful, a crime or not a
crime. . . .


**15.** To conceive moral·ly significant· actions correctly, we
must look at them in two different ways. **1** First, as they
are in themselves, each made up of a certain collection of
·qualities represented by· simple ideas.
Thus ‘drunkenness’
and ‘lying’ signify certain collections of simple ideas, which
I call mixed modes; and understood in this way they are
just as much positive absolute ideas ·with nothing relational,
and so nothing moral, about them· as are ‘the drinking of
a horse’ and ‘the speaking of a parrot’. **2** Secondly, our
actions are considered as good, bad, or neither; and this is a
relational way of looking at them, because what makes them
regular or irregular, good or bad, is their conformity to or
disagreement with some rule; and the comparison with a rule
puts them into the category of relation.
Thus duelling—·a
positive, non-relational label·—is •a sin in relation to the
law of God, •valour and virtue according to some laws of
fashion, and •a capital crime according to the laws of some
lands.
In this case the action has one name (‘duelling’) taken
just as a positive mode, and another name (‘sin’ etc.) as it
stands in relation to the law; and the two names make it
easy to grasp the difference between the non-relational and
relational ways of looking at it; just as with substances we
can have one name ‘man’) to signify the thing and another
(‘father’) to signify the relation.


**16.** The positive idea of an action is often expressed in a word
that also conveys the action’s moral relation, so that a single
word expresses both the action itself and its moral rightness
or wrongness. [Locke then warns against assuming that an
action that falls under the non-moral part of such a word’s
meaning must also fall under the moral part.
He concludes
with an example:] Taking a madman’s sword away from
him without authority, though it is properly called ‘stealing’,
understood as the ·non-relational· name of a mixed mode, is



nevertheless not a sin or transgression in relation to the law
of God.


[In section **17** Locke says that he thinks he has dealt with
‘some of the most considerable’ kinds of relation, and that
there is no easy way to classify relations in general, because
they are so numerous and various.
He then announces a
final trio of points.]


**18.** First, it is evident that all relations ultimately come
down to the simple ideas we have acquired from sensation or
reflection [Locke: ‘all relation terminates in and is ultimately
founded on those simple ideas’].
So when we think or
meaningfully say anything of a relational kind, all we have in
our thoughts are some simple ideas, or collections of simple
ideas, compared one with another.
Nothing could be more
obvious than this in the case of relations of the sort called
‘proportional’: when a man says ‘Honey is sweeter than
wax’, it is plain that his thoughts terminate in the simple
idea _sweetness_ .
This is equally true of all the rest ·of our
relational thoughts·, though often the simple ideas are not
taken notice of because the compounds containing them are
so complex.
When the word ‘father’ is used, its meaning
involves •the particular species or collective idea signified by
the word ‘man’, •the sensible simple ideas signified by the
word ‘generation’, and •the effects of generation including
all the simple ideas signified by the word ‘child’. [Locke
gives a second example—a partial analysis of the meaning
of ‘friend’, in which the fifth ingredient is] the idea of _good_,
which signifies anything that may advance his happiness.
This ·thought· terminates at last in particular simple ideas;
the word ‘good’ in general can signify any one of these, but
if it is entirely removed from all simple ideas it signifies
nothing. . . .


**19.** Secondly, in relations we usually—if not always—have
as clear a notion of the relation as we have of the things
related. . . .
If I know what it is for one man to be born of a
woman, I know what it is for another man to be born of the
same woman, and so have as clear a notion of _brothers_ as of
_births_ .
Perhaps clearer!
For if I believed that his mother dug
Titus out of the parsley-bed (as they used to tell children)
and thereby became his mother, and that afterwards in the
same way she dug Caius out of the parsley-bed, I would
have as clear a notion of the relation of _brothers_ between
them as if I had all the skill of a midwife. . . .
But though
•the ideas of particular relations can be as clear and distinct
in the minds of thoughtful people as those of mixed modes,
and more determinate than those of substances, •words
expressing relations are often as doubtful and uncertain in
their meanings as names of substances or mixed modes, and
much more than names of simple ideas.
That is because



a relational word is the mark of a comparison between two
things—·an upshot of considering them together·—and this
is something that occurs only in men’s thoughts; it is merely
an idea in men’s minds; and it often happens that men apply
a single relational word to different comparisons of things,
according to their own imaginations, which don’t always
correspond with those of others using the same word.


**20.** Thirdly, in moral relations (as I call them) I get a true
relational thought by comparing the action with the rule,
whether the rule itself is true or false. ·Similarly· if I measure
a thing by a yardstick, I know whether the thing is longer or
shorter than that supposed yard; but whether the yardstick
I am using really is exactly a yard long is another question.
Even if the rule I am invoking is wrong, and I am mistaken
in relying on it, still I may perceive accurately that the action
in question does, or that it doesn’t, conform to it.


# **Chapter xxix: Clear and obscure, distinct and confused ideas**



**1.** I have shown the origin of our ideas, and surveyed their
various sorts; and I have considered how the simple ones
differ from the complex, and observed how the complex
ones are divided into those of modes, substances, and
relations.
All this, I think, needs to be done by anyone
who wants a thorough grasp of how the mind develops in
its understanding and knowledge of things.
You may think I
have spent long enough examining ideas, but please let me
say a little more about them.
The first point is that some are
clear and others obscure, some distinct and others confused.



**2.** The perception of the mind is most aptly explained by
words relating to eyesight, so we shall best understand what
‘clear’ and ‘obscure’ mean as applied to ideas by reflecting
on what they mean when applied to the objects of sight.
Light is what reveals visible objects to us, so we describe as
‘obscure’ anything that isn’t placed in a good enough light
to reveal in detail its shape and colours.
Similarly, a simple
idea is ‘clear’ when it is like an idea that one might receive
in a well-ordered sensation or perception from an object
of the kind that it comes from.
While the memory retains


them thus, and can produce them to the mind whenever
it has occasion to consider them, they are _clear_ ideas.
In
so far as they either lack some of the original exactness, or
have lost any of their first freshness and are (so to speak)
faded or tarnished by time, to that extent they are obscure.
Complex ideas are clear when •their constituent simple ideas
are clear and •the number and order of the simple ideas in
the complex one is determinate and certain.


**3.** The causes of obscurity in simple ideas seem to be either
•dull sense-organs, or •weak and fleeting impressions made
by the objects, or else •a weakness in the memory which can’t
retain them in the condition in which they were originally
received.
Think of the sense-organs or perceptual faculties in
terms of sealing wax. •Frozen wax is too hard and won’t take
an impression when the seal is pressed down on it in the
usual way; •the wax that is all right won’t take an impression
because the seal isn’t pressed down hard enough; and •very
warm wax is too soft to retain the impression the seal gives
it.
In any of these cases the print left by the seal will be
_obscure_ .
It is presumably clear enough how this applies to
the obscurity of ideas.


**4.** A _clear_ idea—·I repeat·—is one of which the mind has a
perception that is as full and evident as it receives from an
outward object operating properly on a healthy sense-organ.
And a _distinct_ idea is one in which the mind perceives a
difference from all other ideas, and a confused idea is one
that isn’t sufficiently distinguishable from another idea from
which it ought to be different. ·This rather compressed and
difficult account will become clearer in the course of the next
two sections·.


**5.** It may be objected: ‘If the only way for an idea to be
confused is for it to be inadequately distinguishable from
another idea from which it should be different, it is hard to



see how there can be any confused ideas.
Whatever an idea
is like, it can’t be different from what the mind perceives it to
be; and that very perception sufficiently distinguishes it from
all other ideas, for they can’t be _other_ ideas—that is _different_
ideas—without being perceived to be so.
So no idea can be
indistinguishable from another idea from which it ought to
be different, unless you mean that it is different from itself;
for from all _other_ ideas it is obviously different.’


**6.** To remove this difficulty, and to help us to conceive
correctly what the confusion is that ideas are sometimes
accused of, we should note that things brought under different names are supposed to be different enough to be
distinguished from one another, that so each sort can be
marked off by its own special name and talked about, as
need arises, separately from anything else.
Quite obviously,
most ·pairs of· different names are supposed to stand for
·pairs of· different things.
Now, every idea that a man has
is visibly what it is, and is distinct from all other ideas; so
what makes it _confused_ is its being such that it may as well
be called by a name other than the one it is expressed by.
Some things are supposed to fall under one of those names
and others under the other; but in the sort of case just
described—where someone has an idea that could go with
either name—the difference has been lost.


**7.** The usual faults that lead to such confusion are, I think,
of the following ·four· kinds.
First, ·omission·.
A complex
idea (for they are the ones most liable to confusion) may be
made up of too few simple ideas, containing only ideas ·all
of· which are common to other things as well; in which case
the idea leaves out the differences that entitle it to a different
name.
Thus someone who has an idea of merely _a beast with_
_spots_ has only a confused idea of a _leopard_, because it isn’t
distinguished from that of a lynx and other sorts of spotted


beasts. . . .
You might want to consider how much the custom
of defining words by general terms contributes to making the
ideas we try to express by them confused and undetermined.
This much is obvious: confused ideas bring uncertainty into
the use of words, and take away the advantages of having
distinct names.


**8.** Secondly, ·jumbling·.
Another fault that makes our
ideas confused occurs when, although the particulars that
make up a ·complex· idea are numerous enough, they are
so jumbled that it isn’t easy to see whether the idea belongs
more properly to the name that is given it than to some
other.
The best way to understand this kind of confusion is
to attend to a sort of pictures usually shown as surprising
pieces of art, in which the colours, as they are laid by the
pencil on the page itself, mark out very odd and unusual
figures with no discernible order in their layout.
This sketch,
made up of parts in which no symmetry or order appears,
is in itself no more a confused thing than the picture of a
cloudy sky.
The latter may have as little order of colours
or shapes as the former, but nobody thinks it a confused
picture.
Then what makes it [i.e. the first picture] be thought
of as confused, if not its lack of symmetry? (And that
lack plainly doesn’t make it confused; for a picture that
perfectly imitated this one ·would also lack symmetry etc.,
yet· wouldn’t be called confused.) I answer that the picture
is thought to be confused when it is given a name that isn’t
discernibly more appropriate to it than some other name.
For example, when it is said to be the picture of a man (or of
Caesar), then any reasonable person counts it as confused if
it can’t be seen to fit ‘man’ (or ‘Caesar’) any more than it fits
‘baboon’ (or ‘Pompey’). . . .
That is how it is with our ideas,
which are as it were the pictures of things.
No one of these
mental sketches, however its parts are put together, can be



called ‘confused’ until it is classified under some ordinary
name that can’t be seen to fit it any more than does some
other name whose meaning is agreed to be different.


**9.** Thirdly, ·wavering·.
A third defect that frequently qualifies
our ideas as ‘confused’ occurs when one of them is uncertain
and undetermined.
We sometimes see people who use the
ordinary words of their language without waiting to learn
their precise meaning, and change the idea they make this or
that term stand for, almost as often as they use it.
Someone
who does this because he isn’t sure what to include in, and
what to exclude from, his idea of _church_ or _idolatry_ every
time he thinks of either, and doesn’t hold steady to any one
precise combination of ideas that makes it up, is said to have
a ‘confused idea’ of idolatry or of the church.
The reason for
saying this is the same as for speaking of ‘confusion’ where
there is jumbling.
It is because a changeable idea—if indeed
we can call it one idea—can’t belong to one name rather than
another; and so it loses the distinction that distinct names
are designed for.


**10.** What I have said shows how much names—which
are supposed to be steady signs of things, and through
their differences to keep different things distinct ·in our
minds·—are the occasion for labelling ideas as ‘distinct’ or
‘confused’, through the mind’s secretly and covertly relating
its ideas to such names.
This may be more fully understood
in the light of my treatment of words in Book III.
Without
bringing in the relation of ideas to distinct names, as the
signs of distinct things, it will be hard to say what a ‘confused
idea’ is. . . .


**12.** I think that this is the kind of confusion that is special
to _ideas_, though even it involves a secret reference to _names_ .
Even if there is some other way for ideas to be confused,
the one I have described is what mostly disorders men’s


thoughts and discourses (for what men have in their minds
whenever they converse with one another, and usually even
when they are silently thinking, are _ideas ranked under_
_names_ ). . . .
The way to prevent this is to unite into one
complex idea, as precisely as possible, all those ingredients
that differentiate a given idea from others; and always to
apply the same name to that complex.
But this exactness
is rather to be wished for than to be expected, because
it is laborious and requires self-criticism, and it doesn’t
serve any purpose except the discovery of naked truth—
which isn’t everyone’s goal!
And since the loose application
of names to _undetermined_, _variable_, and almost _no_ ideas,
serves both to cover our own ignorance and to perplex and
confound others—which counts as learning and superiority
in knowledge!—it is no wonder that most men should engage
in such faults themselves while complaining of it in others.
But although I think that much of the confusion to be found
in the notions of men could be avoided through care and
ingenuity, I am far from concluding that it is all wilful.
Some
ideas are so rich and complex that (a) the memory doesn’t
easily retain the very same precise combination of simple
ideas under one name; (b) much less are we able constantly
to guess what precise complex idea such a name stands for
in another man’s use of it.
From (a) follows confusion in a
man’s own reasonings and opinions within himself; from (b)
confusion in talking and arguing with others.
I shall return
to words, their defects and misuses, in Book III.


**13.** A complex idea is made up of a collection of different
simple ones, so that it can be very clear and distinct in one
part yet obscure and confused in another.
When someone
speaks of a chiliahedron, or a body with a thousand sides,
the ideas of the shape may be confused though that of
the number is distinct.
He can talk about and do proofs



concerning that part of his complex idea that depends on the
number 1000, which may lead him to think that he has a
distinct idea of a chiliahedron; yet he plainly doesn’t have a
precise idea of its shape that would enable him to distinguish
a chiliahedron by its shape from a figure that has only 999
sides.
Unawareness of this problem causes no small error in
men’s thoughts and confusion in their talk.


[Section **14** develops this point, contrasting two pairs of physical things: (a) a 1000-sided one and a 999-sided one, and
(b) a cubic one and a five-sided one.
We can distinguish the
members of (a) through the different numbers (by counting
the sides) but not by their different shapes, whereas we can
distinguish the members of (b) in either way.]


**15.** We often use the word ‘eternity’, and think we have a positive comprehensive idea of it, which means that every part
of that duration is clearly contained in our idea.
Someone
who thinks this may indeed have

a very clear idea of duration,
a clear idea of a very great length of duration, and
a clear idea of the comparison of the latter with a still
greater duration.
But he can’t possibly include in his idea of any duration,
however great, the _whole extent_ of a duration in which
he supposes no end; so the part of his idea that reaches
beyond the bounds of that large duration he represents to
his own thoughts—·that is, beyond the largest duration that
he represents clearly·—is very obscure and undetermined.
That is why, in disputes and reasonings concerning eternity
or any other infinite, we are apt to blunder and to involve
ourselves in obvious absurdities.


[In the long section **16** Locke discusses the attempts one
might make to think clearly and positively about infinity.
This discussion doesn’t add any doctrine to what has been


said in xvii.
All our attempts to think of infinite duration,
or of infinitely extended or infinitely divisible space, he says,
end up as attempts to think of infinite _number_ . ‘When we
talk about infinite divisibility of body, or about ·infinite·
extension, our distinct and clear ideas are only of _numbers_ ;
and after some progress of division the clear distinct ideas of



_extension_ are quite lost.’ As for the idea of infinite number,
Locke dramatizes the inaccessibility (he thinks) of that by
remarking that the attempt to reach it by successive additions of 400,000,000 is _no better_ than trying to reach it by
successive additions of 4.]


# **Chapter xxx: Real and fantastical ideas**



**1.** There are other ways in which ideas can be thought of
in relation to things from which they are taken, or things
they are supposed to represent.
These, I think, yield a trio of
distinctions.
Ideas may be

real or fantastical,
adequate or inadequate,
true or false.
·I shall treat the first pair in this chapter, the second in xxxi,
and the third in xxxii·.
By _real_ ideas I mean ones that have
a foundation in nature, and conform to the real being and
existence of things, or to their archetypes [= ‘patterns or models

from which they are copied’].
_Fantastical_ or chimerical ideas are
ones that have no foundation in nature, and don’t conform
to that objective reality to which they are tacitly referred as
to their archetypes.
Let us apply this distinction to the sorts
of ideas that I have distinguished.


**2.** First, our • _simple ideas_ are all real, all agree to the
reality of things.
That isn’t to say that they are all images
or representations of what exists, for I have shown that this
isn’t so except with the primary qualities of bodies.
But



though whiteness and coldness are no more in snow than
pain is, yet the ideas of whiteness and coldness, as well
as of pain, are effects in us of powers in things outside us;
they are _real_ ideas in us, through which we distinguish the
qualities that are really in things themselves.
These various
appearances were designed by God to be signs enabling us to
know and distinguish things that we have to deal with; and
our ideas can serve that purpose for us by being _constant_
_effects_ rather than _exact resemblances_ of outer things.
Their
status as ‘real’ comes from how they dependably _correspond_
with the constitutions of real beings; and it doesn’t matter
whether they correspond as _effects_ or as _likenesses_ .
So
our simple ideas are all real and true, because they answer
and agree to the powers of things that produce them in our
minds; that being all it takes to make them real. . . .


**3.** Though the mind is wholly passive in respect of its simple
ideas, it isn’t so in respect of its complex ideas.They are
combinations of simple ideas that have been assembled and
united under one general name, and clearly the human
mind has a certain freedom in forming them.
How can


it happen that one man’s idea of gold, or of justice, is
different from another’s?
It can only be because one •has
included or omitted from his complex idea some simple
idea that the other •has not.
Well, then: which of these
·voluntarily constructed complex ideas· are real, and which
merely imaginary combinations?
What collections agree to
the reality of things, and what not? ·My answer to that
comes in two parts, one section each·.


**4.** Second: - _mixed modes_ and _relations_ have no reality
except what they have in the minds of men, so all that is
required for any such idea to be ‘real’ is that it be such that
there _could_ be something real to which it conformed.
These
ideas are themselves archetypes—·their own archetypes·—
and so there can be no question of their differing from their
archetypes ·and thus from themselves·!
So the only way
such an idea can chimerical is by its containing a jumble of
inconsistent ideas.
Even when a complex idea isn’t inconsistent, it may be
‘fantastical’ in a certain sense because someone uses it
as a meaning of a word that doesn’t ordinarily have that
meaning—like using ‘justice’ to mean what is commonly
meant by ‘liberality’.
But this fantasticalness relates more to
propriety of speech than reality of ideas.
Consider these two
ideas:


•being undisturbed in danger, calmly considering what
it is best to do, and steadily doing it,
•being undisturbed in danger, without thinking or



doing anything.
Each of these is a mixed mode, a complex idea of a state
of being that could exist.
The former of them fits the word
‘courage’ better than the other, which has no commonly
accepted name in any known language; but there is nothing
at all wrong with the latter considered just in itself.


**5.** Third: our • _complex ideas of substances_ are all made in
reference to things existing outside us, and are intended to
represent substances as they really are.
So such an idea
is real only to the extent that it is a compound of simple
ideas ·of qualities· that are really united in things without
us.
On the other side, those are fantastical that are made
up of collections of simple ideas ·of qualities· that were never
really united, never found together in any substance—such
as

•a rational creature, consisting of a horse’s head, joined
to a body of human shape, or
•a body that is yellow, malleable, fusible, and fixed [=

‘easily volatilized’], but lighter than common water, or
•a uniform, unstructured body that is capable of perception and voluntary motion.
Whether such substances _can_ exist we don’t know; but we
should count the ideas of them as merely imaginary because
they don’t conform to any pattern existing that we know, and
consist of collections of ideas ·of qualities· that no substance
has ever shown us united together.
But they are not _as_
imaginary as the complex ideas that contain in them some
inconsistency or contradiction among their parts.


# **Chapter xxxi: Adequate and inadequate ideas**



**1.** Of our real ideas, some are adequate and some inadequate.
I call ‘adequate’ the ones that •perfectly represent
the archetypes that the mind supposes them to have been
copied from, which it intends them to stand for, and to which
it refers them. ‘Inadequate’ ideas are ones that •only partly
or incompletely represent those archetypes to which they are
referred. ·Let us now apply this distinction to each of our
three big categories of ideas·.


**2.** First: all our • _simple ideas_ are adequate.
They are nothing
but the effects of certain powers in things that are fit, and
ordained by God, to produce such sensations in us; so they
must correspond to and be adequate to those powers, and
we are sure they agree with the reality of things.
If sugar
produce in us the ideas of whiteness and sweetness, we
are sure there is a power in sugar to produce those ideas
in our minds, or else they couldn’t have been produced by
it.
Thus, because each sensation corresponds to the power
that operates on our senses, the idea so produced is a real
idea, (and not a fiction of the mind, which has no power to
produce any simple idea); and it cannot but be adequate
since it ought only to correspond to that power.
So all simple
ideas are adequate.
It is true that we often talk inaccurately about the causes
of these simple ideas of ours, using expressions that suggest
that those ideas are real beings in the causally operative
things.
The fire’s power of producing in us the idea of pain
we correctly report by saying that the fire •‘is painful to the
touch’; but we handle differently its power to cause in us
ideas of light and heat, saying that the fire itself •‘is bright’
and •‘is hot’, as though light and heat were not merely ideas
in us but qualities in, or of, the fire.
When I speak of things as



having secondary _qualities_, please understand me as talking
only about those powers. (I need to call them ‘qualities’ in
order to fit in with common ways of talking, for otherwise I
wouldn’t be well understood.) If there were no organs fit to
receive the impressions fire makes on the sight and touch,
or no mind joined to those organs to receive the ideas of light
and heat through those impressions from the fire or sun,
there would be no light or heat in the world (any more than
there would be pain if there were no creature to feel it), even
though Mount Aetna flamed higher than ever.
In contrast,
solidity, extension, shape, and motion and rest would still be
really in the world if there were no sentient being to perceive
them. . . .


**3.** Second: our • _complex ideas of modes_, being voluntary
collections of simple ideas that the mind puts together,
without reference to any real archetypes or standing patterns
existing anywhere, have to be adequate ideas.
They aren’t
intended to be copies of things really existing; we have them
only as archetypes made by the mind to serve as standards
for classifying and naming things; so they can’t lack anything.
Each of them has the combination of ideas, and thus the
perfection, that the mind intended it to have.
Thus by having
the idea of _a figure with three sides meeting at three angles_
I have a complete idea that needs nothing more to make it
perfect.
That the mind is satisfied with the perfection of this
one of its ideas is plain in that it has no thought of how there
can be a _more_ complete or perfect idea of _triangle_ than that.
Contrast this with our ideas of substances: we want _them_
to copy things as they really are, and to represent to us that
constitution on which all the substances’ properties depend;
and we see that our ideas don’t reach the intended level of


perfection.
We find that they still lack something that we
would like them to contain, and so they are all inadequate.
But mixed modes and relations, being archetypes without
patterns, and so having nothing to represent but themselves,
_must_ be adequate because everything is adequate to itself!
Whoever first put together the idea of

danger perceived, absence of disorder from fear, calm
consideration of what was justly to be done, and doing
it without disturbance or being deterred by the danger
of it
certainly had in his mind the complex idea made up of
that combination; and as he intended it to be nothing but
what is, and to contain only the simple ideas that it has, it
couldn’t fail to be an adequate idea.
And by laying this up
in his memory with the name ‘courage’ attached to it, he
gave himself a standard by which to measure and describe
actions, according to whether they agreed with it.
This idea
thus made and laid up as a pattern must necessarily be
adequate, as it is referred to nothing but itself, and takes
it origin purely from the will of him who first made this
combination.


[Section **4** makes the point that a second person may intend
to use ‘courage’ with the same meaning—expressing the
same idea—as the first, and yet get it wrong, associating the
word with some other idea.
In that case, _his_ idea of courage
is inadequate.]


[In **5** the point is developed further.
Locke concludes:] In
this way, but in no other, any idea of modes can be wrong,
imperfect, or inadequate.
And on this account our ideas
of mixed modes are more liable to be faulty than any other
kind; but this has to do with proper speaking rather than
with true knowledge.


**6.** Third: I have shown above ·in xxiii· what ideas we have



of • _substances_ .
Now, those ideas have in the mind a double
reference: **1** Sometimes they are referred to a supposed _real_
_essence_ of each species of things. **2** Sometimes they are
designed only to be pictures and representations in the mind
of existing things, containing ·simple· ideas of the qualities
we can discover in those things.
In each of these respects,
ideas of substances—these copies of those originals and
archetypes—are imperfect and inadequate. ·I shall explain
why for **1** in this section and the next, and for **2** in sections
8–10·.


Men usually make the names of substances stand for
things considered as having certain _real essences_, which
are what put them into this or that species.
And because
_names_ stand for nothing but the ideas in men’s minds, men
must constantly refer their _ideas_ to such real essences as
though they were what the idea was meant to represent.
It
is regarded as a commonplace, especially among those who
have grown up with the scientific ideas taught in this part
of the world, that each individual substance has a specific
essence which makes it belong to a certain kind.
Almost
anyone who calls himself ‘a man’ takes himself to mean that
he has the real essence of _man_ .
But if you ask what those
real essences are, men obviously don’t know.
It follows,
then, that the ideas in their minds, purporting to represent
_unknown_ real essences, must be so far from being adequate
that they can’t be supposed to be any representation of them
at all. complex ideas of substances are certain collections
of simple ideas ·of qualities· that have been observed or
supposed constantly to exist together.
But such a complex
idea can’t be the real essence of any substance; for then the
properties we discover in that body would depend on that
complex idea, and be deducible from it, and their necessary
connection with it be known; as all the properties of a triangle
depend on and (as far as we can discover them) are deducible


from the complex idea of _three lines enclosing a space_ .
But
our complex ideas of substances obviously don’t contain
such ideas on which all the other discoverable qualities of
the substance depend.
The common idea men have of iron
is _a body of a certain colour, weight and hardness_, and they
also think of iron as _malleable_ ; but this property has no
necessary connection with that complex idea; and there is
no more reason to think that malleableness depends on
that colour etc. than to think that colour etc. depends on
malleableness.
Yet it is _very_ common for men to think that
what puts things into different _sorts_ is their different _real_
_essences_, unknown as they are.
Consider the particular portion of matter that makes
the ring I have on my finger: most men will unhesitatingly
suppose it to have a real essence that makes it gold, and from
which flow the qualities I find in it, namely its special colour,
weight, hardness, fusibility, fixedness, and change of colour
upon a slight touch of mercury, etc.
When I enquire into
and search for the essence from which all these properties
·supposedly· flow, it becomes obvious to me that I can’t
discover it.
The furthest I can go is to make this presumption:
because the portion of matter is nothing but _body_, its real
essence or internal constitution on which its other qualities
depend must be _the shapes, sizes, and connection of its solid_
_parts_ .
I have no distinct perception of any of this, so I can
have no idea of that essence.
If anyone says that the real essence and internal constitution on which these properties depend isn’t the shape,
size, and arrangement or connection of its solid parts, but
something else called its particular _form_, this takes me still
further away from having any idea of its real essence. ·Before
‘form’ came into the story, I did have _something_ ·.
For I have
an idea of shape, size, and situation of solid parts _in general_,
though I have none of the _particular_ shape, size, etc. that



produce the qualities that I have mentioned—qualities that
I find in the portion of matter circling my finger and not in
the different portion of matter with which I trim my pen.
But
when I am told that something other than shape, size, etc.
is its essence, something called ‘substantial form’, I confess
to having no idea _at all_ of this, but only of the sound of the
word ‘form’, which is a good distance from an idea of a real
essence or constitution!
I am equally ignorant of ·the details of· the real essence of
this particular substance and of the real essences of all other
natural kinds of substance.
I think that others who examine
their own knowledge will find themselves to be ignorant in
the same way.


**7.** When men apply the word ‘gold’ to this particular portion
of matter on my finger, don’t they usually mean the word to
imply the matter’s belonging to a particular species of bodies
by virtue of its having a real internal essence?
Yes, they
do.
So for them the word ‘gold’ must be referred primarily
to that essence, and so the idea that goes with it must also
be referred to that essence and be intended to represent it.
·But an idea _can’t_ represent something of which the idea’s
owner knows nothing·.
So those who use the word ‘gold’, not
knowing the real essence of gold, have an idea of gold that is
_inadequate_ because it doesn’t contain that real essence that
the mind intends it to.
The same applies to all other natural
kinds of substance.


**8.** Setting aside the useless supposition of unknown real
essences, we can try to copy the substances that exist in the
world by putting together the ideas of the _sensible qualities_
that are found coexisting in them.
This brings us much
nearer to a likeness of them than is achieved by those
who think in terms of real specific essences; but we still
don’t arrive at perfectly adequate ideas of the substances in


question; our ideas don’t exactly and fully contain all the
qualities that are to be found in their archetypes.
That is
because those qualities and powers of substances are so
many and various that nobody’s complex idea contains them
all.
Men rarely put into their complex idea of any substance
all the simple ideas ·of qualities that· they know to exist
in that substance.
Wanting to make the meanings of their
words as clear and manageable as they can, they usually
put into their specific ideas of the sorts of substance only a
few of the simple ideas ·of qualities· that are to be found in
them.
But these have no special claim to be included while
others are left out, so that clearly in both these ways—·that
is, in the ideas of sensible qualities that they include, as
well as in their secret reference to real essences·—our ideas
of substances are deficient and inadequate. ·It isn’t merely
that our ideas _do_ omit many of the discoverable qualities of
the substance; they _must_ do so, for the following reason·.
Except for shape and size in some cases, the simple ideas
out of which we make our complex ideas of substances
are all _powers_ that are also relations to other substances.
·For example, a loadstone’s magnetic quality is its _power_ to
_attract iron_ ; a flower’s yellowness is its _power_ to _affect our_
_eyesight_ in a certain way·.
So we can never be sure that we
know all the powers of a body until we have tried out how it
can change or be changed by other substances when related
to them in various ways.
It is impossible to try all of that for
any one body, much less for all bodies, so we can’t possibly
bring any substance under an adequate idea made up of a
collection of _all_ its properties.


[In sections **9–10** Locke develops this line of thought, emphasizing how numerous the qualities of any kind of substance
are, and how relatively accidental it is which subset of
them get into the meaning of the common name for a kind



of substance.
He concludes section 10 with this remark
about numerousness:] This won’t appear so much a paradox
to anyone who thinks about that fairly simple figure _the_
_triangle_ —how much mathematicians have learned about it,
and how far they still are from knowing all its properties.


**11.** So all our complex ideas of substances are imperfect
and inadequate.
The same would hold for mathematical
figures if our complex ideas of them had to collect—·one by
onew·—their properties in reference to other figures. ·In that
case·, how uncertain and imperfect our idea of an _ellipse_
would be, containing only a few of its properties!
In fact,
though, we have in our plain [Locke’s word] idea the whole
essence of that figure, from which we discover its other
properties and demonstratively see how they flow from it.


**12.** Thus the mind has three sorts of abstract ideas.
First,
_simple ideas_, which are copies, and are certainly adequate.
That is because such an idea is intended to express nothing
but the power in things to produce in the mind such a
sensation ·or idea·, so that when that sensation is produced
it must be the effect of that power. . . .


**13.** Secondly, the _complex ideas of substances_ are copies
too, but not perfect ones, not adequate.
This is very evident
to the mind, which plainly perceives that whatever collection
of simple ideas it makes of any real ·kind of· substance,
it can’t be sure that it matches all ·the qualities· that are
in that substance. . . .
Furthermore, even if we had in our
complex idea an exact collection of all the secondary qualities
or powers of any substance, that wouldn’t give us an idea of
the essence of that thing.
The powers or qualities that are
observable by us are not the real essence of that substance;
they depend on it, and flow from it.
Besides, a man has no
idea of substance in general, nor knows what substance is
in itself. ·See xxiii.1–2·.


**14.** Thirdly, _complex ideas of modes and relations_ are originals, and archetypes; they aren’t copies, aren’t made after
the pattern of any real existence that the mind intends them
to fit and exactly to correspond to.
Each of these collections



of simple ideas that the mind itself puts together contains in
it precisely all that the mind intends that it should. . . .
The
ideas of modes and relations, therefore, have to be adequate.


# **Chapter xxxii: True and false ideas**



**1.** Though ‘true’ and ‘false’ are strictly applicable only to
propositions, _ideas_ are also often described as true or false.
(What words are _not_ used with great latitude, and with
some deviation from their strict and proper meanings?) I
think, though, that when ideas are termed ‘true’ or ‘false’
there is still some secret or tacit proposition on which that
description is based.
Look at particular occasions where
ideas are called true or false, and you’ll find some kind of
affirmation or negation at work.
Ideas, being nothing but
bare appearances or perceptions in our minds, can’t properly
and simply in themselves be said to be true or false, any
more than a single name can be said to be true or false.


**2.** Indeed both ideas and words may be called ‘true’ in a
metaphysical sense of the word according to which anything
that exists is ‘true’—that is, really is such as it is.
Even
when something is called ‘true’ in that sense, though, there
is perhaps a secret reference to our ideas, looked on as
the standards of that truth.
That amounts to a mental
proposition, though it is usually not taken notice of.


**3.** But our present topic is not that metaphysical sense
of ‘true’, but rather the more ordinary meanings of ‘true’
and ‘false’.
In the ordinary sense, then: the ideas in our



minds are only so many perceptions or appearances there,
so none of _them_ are false.
The idea of a centaur has no more
falsehood in it when it appears in our minds than the name
‘centaur’ has falsehood in it when someone speaks or writes
it.
Truth or falsehood resides always in some _affirmation or_
_negation_, mental or verbal; none of our ideas can be false
until the mind passes some judgment on it, that is, affirms
or denies something of it.


**4.** Whenever the mind refers one of its ideas to something
extraneous to it, the idea becomes a candidate for being
true or false, because in such a reference the mind tacitly
assumes that the idea _fits_ the external thing.
According to
whether that assumption is true or false, so can the idea
itself be described.
The most usual cases of this are the
following ·three·.


**5.** First, when the mind assumes that one of its ideas
matches the idea in other men’s minds called by the same
common name; for example, when the mind intends or
judges its ideas of _justice_, _temperance_, _religion_ to be the
same as what other men give those names to.
Secondly, when the mind supposes that one of it ideas
fits some real existence.
Thus the ideas of _man_ and _centaur,_


supposed to be the ideas of real substances, are true and
false respectively, one having a conformity to what has really
existed, the other not.
Thirdly, when the mind refers an idea to the _real constitu-_
_tion and essence_ of a thing on which all the thing’s properties
depend.
In this way most if not all our ideas of substances
are false.


**6.** . . . .It is chiefly, if not only, concerning its _abstract_
complex ideas that the mind makes such assumptions.
Its
natural tendency is towards knowledge; and it finds that
if it dwelt only on particular things its progress would be
very slow and its work endless; so it shortens its route to
knowledge, and makes each perception [here = ‘idea’] more
comprehensive, by binding things into bundles and grouping
into _sorts_, so that what knowledge it gets of any of them it
may confidently extend to all of that _sort_ .
This enables it to
advance by longer strides towards knowledge, which is its
great business. . . .


**7.** . . . .
When the mind has acquired an idea that it thinks
it may be useful in thought or in talk, the first thing it does
is to abstract it, and then get •a name for it; and so tuck
it away in its store-house, the memory, as containing the
essence of a sort of things of which •that name is always
to be the mark.
When someone sees a new thing and asks
‘What is it?’, he is only asking what its •name is, as though
the name carried with it the knowledge of the species, or of
its essence. . . .


**8.** •This abstract idea is something in the mind between •the
thing that exists and •the name that is given to it. (·The •idea
is what connects the •name with the •thing; for example,
what makes ‘ring’ the right word for the thing around my
finger is that **1** word ‘ring’ is associated with a certain
abstract idea, and **2** that idea fits or conforms to the thing



encircling my finger·.) So the rightness of our knowledge and
the propriety and intelligibleness of our speaking both rely
on our ideas.
That is why men so freely suppose that the
abstract ideas they have in their minds •agree to the outer
things to which they are referred, and •are also the ones
that commonly go with the names with which they associate
them.
Without this double conformity of their ideas, they
would •think wrongly about things in themselves, and •talk
unintelligibly about them to others. ·I shall discuss •talk in
sections 9–12 and •thought in 13–18·.


**9.** First, when the truth of our ideas is judged by whether
they match the ideas other men have and commonly signify
by the same name, any of them _can_ be false.
But simple
ideas are least liable to be mistaken in this way, because
your senses and daily experience easily satisfy you regarding
what the simple ideas are that various common words stand
for.
There aren’t many of them, and if you do suspect you are
wrong about one of them you can easily correct that by going
to the objects that involve them.
So it seldom happens that
anyone goes wrong in his names of simple ideas, applying
the name ‘red’ to the idea _green_, for example, or the name
‘sweet’ to the idea _bitter_ . . . .


**10.** Complex ideas are much more liable to be false in this
manner, and the complex ideas of _mixed modes_ much more
than those of _substances_ .
That is because substances (and
especially ones that have common names in the language
in question) have some conspicuous sensible qualities that
ordinarily serve to distinguish one sort of substance from
another; and this easily preserves careful users of the language from applying words to sorts of substances to which
they don’t belong.
But with mixed modes we are much more
uncertain.
It isn’t so easy to determine of various actions
whether they are to be called ‘justice’ or ‘cruelty’, ‘generosity’


or ‘extravagance’.
And so by the standard of match with the
ideas that other men call by the same name, our idea may
be false.
The idea in our minds that we call ‘justice’ ought
perhaps to have another name.


**11.** But whether or not our ideas of mixed modes _are_ more
liable than any other sort to be different from the idea that
other men mark by the same names, it is certain at least that
this sort of falsehood is much more commonly _attributed to_
our ideas of mixed modes than to any other.
When a man is
thought to have a false idea of justice (or gratitude, or glory),
it is simply because his idea doesn’t match the one that is
the sign of justice (or gratitude, or glory) in the minds of
other men.


**12.** Here is what I think is the reason for this.
An abstract
idea of a mixed mode is a precise collection of simple ideas
that _someone has chosen to put together_ ; and so the essence
of each sort is a human construct, which means that when
we want to know whether a given item belongs to a given
sort we have nowhere to look except to the relevant abstract
idea.
And if I want a _standard_ by which to judge what I am
saying or thinking about the given item, I can only appeal to
the abstract ideas of the people who I think use the relevant
name with its most proper meaning.
That concludes my
discussion of the truth and falsehood of our ideas in relation
to their names.


**13.** Secondly—·picking up again from the end of section
8·—as to the truth and falsehood of our ideas in reference
·not to other people’s ideas, but· to the real existence of
things: when _that_ is the standard of their truth, the only ones
that can be called ‘false’ are our complex ideas of substances.


**14.** Simple ideas are merely perceptions that God has fitted
us to receive, and has enabled external objects to produce



in us; and so their •truth consists purely in their being
•appearances that are suitable to those powers God has
placed in external objects.They _are_ thus suitable, for if they
were not, the objects wouldn’t produce them.
So all such
ideas are true.
Nor do they fall under the charge of falsity
if the mind judges (as in most men I believe it does) that
these ideas are in the things themselves.
God in his wisdom
has set them as marks to help us to distinguish one thing
from another, and it makes no difference to the nature of our
simple idea ·or to its doing for us what God meant it to do·
whether we think that the idea of blue is in the violet itself or
in our mind only. [Locke goes on to expand this point a little,
concluding thus:] The name ‘blue’ stands for that mark of
distinction that is in a violet and that we can discern only
through our eyes, whatever it ·ultimately· consists in, that
being—perhaps fortunately—beyond our capacities to know
in detail.


**15.** Simple ideas wouldn’t be convicted of falsity if through
the different structure of our sense-organs it happened
that one object produced in different men’s minds different
ideas at the same time—for example, if the idea that a
violet produced in one man’s mind by his eyes were what a
marigold produced in another man’s, and vice versa.
This
could never be known, because one man’s mind couldn’t
pass into another man’s body to perceive what appearances
were produced by his organs; so neither the ideas nor the
names would be at all confounded, and there would be no
falsehood in either. . . .
I am nevertheless inclined to think
that the sensible ideas produced by any object in different
men’s minds are usually pretty exactly alike.
Many reasons
could be offered for this opinion, but that is besides my
present business, so I shan’t trouble you with them.
Anyway,
the contrary supposition, if it could be proved, would be


of little use either for the improvement of our knowledge
or convenience of life; so we needn’t trouble ourselves to
examine it.


[In sections **16–18** Locke repeats, with a little more detail,
what he has said before. **16** : simple ideas can’t be ‘false’
because of a wrong relation to external things. **17** : Nor can
complex ideas of modes be ‘false’ in that way, because they
aren’t supposed to represent external things, though they
can be ‘false’ in their relation to common language. **18** : ideas
of substances _can_ be ‘false’ in relation to external things,
either by including a secret reference to a real essence, or
by aiming to include only ideas of perceptible properties of
the substance-kind in question but getting the list of them
wrong.]


**19.** Though in compliance with the ordinary way of speaking
I have shown in what sense and for what reason an _idea_
may be called ‘true’ or ‘false’, if we look more closely we
find that in all those cases what is really true or false is
some _judgment_ that the mind makes or is supposed to make.
Truth and falsehood always involve some affirmation or
negation, explicit or tacit; they are to be found only where
_signs are joined or separated according to the agreement or_
_disagreement of the things they stand for_ .
The signs we
chiefly use are either ideas and words, with which we make
mental and verbal propositions respectively.
Truth lies in
so joining or separating these representatives, according to
whether the things they stand for do in themselves agree or
disagree; and falsehood in the contrary, as I’ll show more
fully later on ·in IV.v·.


**20.** So any idea that we have in our minds, however it relates
to external things or to ideas in the minds of other men, can’t
properly be called false because of such a relation.
Mistake
and falsehood enter the picture in four ways.



**21.** First, there is falsehood when the mind has an idea that
it mistakenly _judges_ to be the same as what other men have
in their minds and signify by the same name, i.e. to conform
to the ordinary received meaning or definition of that word.
This kind of error usually concerns mixed modes, though
other ideas also are liable to it.


**22.** Secondly, falsehood occurs when the mind, having a
complex idea made up of a collection of simple ones such
as nature never puts together, _judges_ it to fit a species of
creatures really existing—for example, joining the weight of
tin to the colour, fusibility and fixedness of gold.


**23.** Thirdly, there is falsehood when the mind makes a
complex idea that unites some simple ideas ·of qualities·
that do really exist together in some sort of thing, while
omitting others that are inseparable from the first lot, and
_judges_ this to be a perfect complete idea of a sort of things
which really it is not.
For example, having joined the ideas
of substance, yellow, malleable, most heavy, and fusible,
the mind takes that to be the complete idea of _gold_, when
really gold’s fixedness and solubility in aqua regia are as
inseparable from those other ideas or qualities as they are
from one another.


**24.** Fourthly, the mistake is even greater when I _judge_ that
this complex idea contains in it the real essence of some
existing body, when really it contains only a few of the properties that flow from its real essence and constitution. [In
the rest of this section Locke defends his saying ‘only a few’.
He remarks yet again on how many properties of triangles
flow from the seemingly simple real essence of _triangle_, and
concludes:] I imagine it is the same with substances: their
real essences are quite small, but the properties flowing from
that internal constitution are endless.


**25.** To conclude, a man has no notion of anything external
to himself except through the idea he has of it in his mind;
he is free to call the idea whatever he pleases, and to make
an idea that neither fits the reality of things nor agrees to
the idea commonly signified by other people’s words; but he
can’t make a wrong or false idea of a thing that is known to
him only through his idea of it.
For example, when I form an
idea of the legs, arms, and body of a man, and join to this a
horse’s head and neck, I don’t make a false idea of anything,
because it represents nothing external to me.
But when I call
it ·the idea of· a ‘man’ or a ‘Tatar’ and imagine it to represent



some real being without me, or to be the same idea that
others call by the same name, _then_ I may err.
That leads to
the idea’s being called ‘false’, though really the falsehood lies
not in the idea but in the tacit mental proposition attributing
to it a fit and a resemblance that it doesn’t have. . . .


[In section **26** Locke suggests that the true/false dichotomy,
as applied to ideas on the basis of their fitting/not-fitting
the ‘patterns to which they are referred’, might be better
expressed in the language of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’.
The point is

# **Chapter xxxiii: The association of ideas**



**1.** Almost anyone who observes the opinions, reasonings,
and actions of other men will have noticed something that
struck him as odd and that really is in itself wild.
Everyone
is quick-sighted enough to spot the least flaw of this kind in
someone else and to condemn it as unreasonable—as long
as the flaw is different from his own version of it.
His own
beliefs and conduct may show him to be guilty of something
worse of the same general kind, but he doesn’t see it in
himself and he’ll probably never be convinced that it is there.


**2.** This flaw doesn’t come wholly from self-love, though that
often has a lot to do with it.
Men of fair minds, not prone
to extravagant self-flattery, are frequently guilty of it; and in
many cases one hears the arguments of such a man with
amazement, astonished at the obstinacy of a worthy man
who doesn’t yield to the evidence of reason even when it is



laid before him as clear as daylight.


**3.** This sort of unreasonableness is usually blamed on
education and prejudice, and for the most part truly enough;
but that doesn’t get to the bottom of the disease, or show
distinctly enough what its ultimate source is or where it is
located.
_Upbringing_ is often rightly assigned as the cause,
and ‘prejudice’ is a good general name for the thing itself;
but you need to dig deeper if you want to trace this sort of
madness to the root from which it comes, explaining it in
a way that will show how this flaw originates in sober and
rational minds, and what it consists in.


**4.** You will pardon my calling it by so harsh a name as
‘madness’ when you reflect that _opposition to reason_ deserves
that name, and really is madness; and almost everyone has
it severely enough to act or argue in some kinds of cases


in ways which, if they spread throughout his life, would
make him a candidate for a mad-house rather than for polite
society.
I don’t mean when he is overpowered by an unruly
passion, but in the steady calm course of his life.
In further
defence of this harsh name, and the unpleasant accusation
that it carries against most of mankind, I remark that when
in xi.13 I enquired a little, in an aside, into the nature of
madness, I found it to have very same cause as the flaw I
am now speaking of.
This struck me as right when I was
thinking just about madness, without any thought of our
present topic.
·One final point in defence of the label ‘madness’ is this·.
If this flaw is a weakness to which all men are liable—a taint
that so universally infects mankind—the greater should be
our care to expose it under its right name, motivating people
to give greater care to its prevention and cure.


**5.** Some of our ideas have a •natural correspondence and
connection with one another, and it is reason’s business
to trace these and to hold the ideas together in the union
and correspondence that is based on _their individual natures_ .
There is also _another_ connection of ideas, arising wholly from

- _chance or custom_ : ideas that have no kinship in themselves
come to be so strongly linked in some men’s minds that it
is very hard to separate them; as soon as one comes into
the understanding its associate appears too, and if more
than two are thus united the whole inseparable group show
themselves together.


**6.** This strong tie between ideas that are not allied by nature
is created by the mind either by choice or by chance, which is
why there are different ties in men with different inclinations,
education, interests, etc.
Custom creates habits of •thinking
in the understanding, as well as of •deciding in the will, and
of •movement of the body.
The habitual bodily movements



·at the most basic level· seem to be movements of the animal
spirits: once these are started up, they continue in the
ways they have been used to; and when these have been
trodden for long enough they are worn into smooth paths,
along which the motion becomes easy and seemingly natural.
As far as we can understand thinking, ideas seem to be
produced thus in our minds—·that is, produced through
the movements of the animal spirits, so that the smoothing
of paths (so to speak) explains intellectual as well as behavioural habits·.
Even if ideas aren’t produced in that way,
the notion of a worn path may nevertheless serve to explain
their following one another in an habitual sequence once it
has been begun, as well as it does to explain such motions
of the body.
A musician who is used to a particular tune will
find that as soon at it begins in his head the ideas of its notes
will follow on in due order in his understanding without any
care or attention on his part, as regularly as his fingers move
in the right order over the keys of the organ to play the tune
he has begun, while his mind is on something else.
This
example suggests that the motion of the organist’s animal
spirits really is the natural cause of his sequence of ideas
of the notes, as well as of the regular dancing of his fingers;
but I shan’t go into that.
In any case, this comparison may
help us a little to conceive of _intellectual habits_, and of the
_tying together of ideas_ .


**7.** That there are such _associations of ideas made by custom_
in the minds of most men won’t, I think, be questioned by
anyone who has attended thoroughly to himself or to others.
Most of the sympathies and antipathies that can be seen
in men might reasonably be assigned to this cause.
The
sympathies etc. work as strongly and produce effects in as
regular a manner as if they were _natural_ ; and that leads
people to think they _are_ natural, though really they arose


from an accidental connection of two ideas which—either
because the first impression was so strong, or because
the person subsequently _allowed_ the two ideas to occur
together in his mind—came to be so united that they always
afterwards kept company together in that man’s mind, as if
they were a single idea.
I say ‘most of the antipathies’, not
‘all’, because some of them are truly natural, depend on our
original constitution, and are born with us.
But many others
are counted natural which would, if they had been observed
with enough care, have been known to arise from unheeded
early impressions or from wanton fancies.
An adult has a
surfeit of honey, after which he reacts badly—with nausea
etc.—to any mention or thought of honey.
He knows when
this weakness of his began, and what caused it.
But if it had
come from an over-dose of honey _when he was a child_, all
the same effects would have followed but he wouldn’t have
recognized its cause and would have regarded the antipathy
as natural.


**8.** My present purposes in this book don’t require me
to distinguish accurately between natural and acquired
antipathies; but I have a different reason for mentioning
that distinction. ·It is to issue a warning·: those who have
children, or have charge of their upbringing, should think
it worth their while to watch carefully to prevent the undue
connection of ideas in the minds of young people.
Early
childhood is the time most susceptible to lasting impressions;
and although discreet people attend to impressions that
could harm the health of the body, and protect the young
against them, those that could harm the mind, and have
their effects in the understanding or the passions, have been
much less heeded than they deserve.
Indeed, those relating
purely to the understanding have, I suspect, been wholly
overlooked by nearly everyone.




[In sections **9–10** Locke develops this theme a little.]


**11.** A man is harmed by another, and thinks about •that
man and •his action over and over; and by brooding over
them strongly or frequently, he cements •those two ideas
together so as to make them almost one.
Whenever he thinks
of the man, the pain and distress he suffered from him comes
into his mind as well, so that he hardly distinguishes them,
and has as much an aversion to the one as to the other.
This is how hatreds often spring from slight and innocent
occasions, and quarrels are propagated and continued in the
world.


[Section **12** presents another example.]


**13.** When this combination ·of ideas· is settled, and for as
long as it lasts, reason is powerless to help us and relieve us
from the effects of it. ·For· once an idea is in our minds, it
will operate according to its nature and circumstances ·and
cannot be swerved or dislodged by reason·.
This lets us see
how the following can happen:

Someone has a recurring emotional pattern that his
reason can’t overthrow, though it _is_ unreasonable,
and this person listens to his reason in other cases.
This disorder is, however, cured by _the passing of_
_time_ .
The death of a child who was the daily delight of his mother’s
eyes and the joy of her soul rips from her heart the whole
comfort of her life and utterly torments her.
To use the
consolations of _reason_ in this case is as useless as to preach
_ease_ to someone on the rack in the hope that rational
discourses will allay the pain of his joints being torn apart.
There is no way of reasoning the woman out of her tie
between the thought of the child and the thought of her
loss of pleasure, but the two thoughts may be separated by


the passing of _time_, through which the tie is weakened by
disuse.
In some such people the union between these ideas
is never dissolved, and they spend their lives in mourning,
and carry an incurable sorrow to their graves.


[Sections **14–16** add anecdotes—some of them quite
extraordinary—concerning associations of ideas.]


**17.** _Intellectual_ habits and defects that come about in this
way are just as frequent and as powerful ·as habits of
behaviour and feeling·, though less notice is taken of them.
Let the ideas of •being and of •matter be strongly joined
either by education or by prolonged thought, and while they
are tied together in a person’s mind, what thoughts and
arguments will he put up concerning unembodied Spirits?
·Because in this person’s thought the idea of something _real_
always brings with it the idea of something _material_, he will
regard the notion of _unembodied Spirit_ —something real and
immaterial—as weird and almost contradictory·.
Let someone from early childhood associate the idea of
•God with the idea of •shape, and what absurdities will he
be liable to believe concerning the Deity?
Let the idea of •infallibility be inseparably joined in someone’s mind to ·the idea of· •some person, and the man whose
mind has this association will swallow any absurdity that
is affirmed by the supposedly infallible person—for example
that a single body can be in two places at once.


**18.** Some such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas
will be found at the root of the irreconcilable opposition
between different sects of philosophy and religion; for we
can’t imagine that every follower of a sect _deliberately sets_
_himself to_ reject, knowingly, truth that is offered by plain
reason.
Self-interest is at work here, but even _it_ can’t
bring a whole society of men to such a universal perversity,
with every single one of them maintaining something that



he knows to be false.
We must allow that at least some
of them _do_ what they all _claim to do_, namely to pursue
truth sincerely; so there must be something that blinds the
understandings of these sectarians, not letting them see the
falsehood of what they embrace as real truth.
What thus
puts their reasons in chains and leads men blindfolded away
from common sense turns out to be my present topic:

Some •ideas that are not naturally allied to one another, are—by upbringing, custom, and the constant
din of the sect—so joined in the sectarians’ minds that
•they always appear there together; and the sectarians
can no more separate •them in their thoughts than if
they were only a single idea—which is what they treat
•them as being.

This gives sense to jargon, demonstration to absurdities, and
consistency to nonsense!
It is the foundation of the greatest
errors in the world.
I almost wrote ‘of all the errors in the
world’; and if it isn’t quite as bad as that, it does produce the
most dangerous errors because when it operates it hinders
men from seeing and examining. [Locke adds some fine
rhetorical flourishes.]


**19.** I have now given an account of the origin, sorts, and
extent of our _ideas_, with several other points concerning
these _instruments or materials of our knowledge_ (may I call
them that?).
The project on which I embarked requires me
now to go on immediately to show how the understanding
uses ideas and what _knowledge_ we have through them.
In
my first general view of the topic, I thought that this was all
that would remain to be done at this point.
But now that I
have reached it, I find that _ideas_ are so closely connected
with _words_, and ·in particular· that _abstract ideas_ are so
regularly related to _general words_, that it is impossible to
speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge (which all


consists in propositions) without considering first the nature,
use, and meanings of language.
That, therefore, is the



business of the next Book.
